      "['i lack all the objective/interpersonal means to do it.*background: since 2013, i suffer from all symptoms of severe depression (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3181882/) mixed with some kind of anxiety disorder with recurrent obsessive-compulsive behaviors (order, hygiene, social phobia…). this has lead me to social isolation and insomnia. no income, totally parent-dependent, dropped out of college, never had a job and only a friend remains loyal. hypothesis: psilocybin (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/psilocybin) has been proved in several clinical studies as the most powerful antidepressant/anxiolytic ever known. a single dose is enough to change psychological markers up to 6 months after intake and toxicity and dependence are near to 0 (tolerance is very high). my guess is that this substance could change my neurochemistry or even inflammation levels (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5542678/) in order to allow an adaptive brain function, ending my depressive-anxious disorder. considering current evidence, our thoughts are made of neurotransmitters, not the other way around: this empirical approach on psychobiology rather than cognitive psychology is the chosen path to follow here. i will not enter in brain receptors details neither how tryptamines look like serotonin etc. since i lack the knowledge.testing: in this first phase, i’ve only taken 2 moderate doses. first of them was 2.5 dried grams of psilocybin cubensis. some visuals, very improved mood, a lot of energy to accomplish simple tasks that i could enjoy and some “philosophical insights”. the major most recent one happened after a couple days after the second dose (1.9g, two weeks after): “attachment is the root of my suffering, the more i convince myself that i need something, the more fear/anxiety/depression i will feel and that’s what is keeping myself away from connecting and loving other people, things, ideas.... because true passion and love cannot happen if there’s the fear of loss or the craving/urgence of accomplishment.”. conclusions: at first sight from a materialistic/western/empirical approach, this reasoning makes no sense. how could you be happy and progress in life if you “don’t give a fuck” about failure/loss/defeat/death? sounds a paradox but it seems my brains works better when it’s released from the burden of attachment (a past/future cognitive dynamic?). i’ll give you an example: i went to buy some food at the supermarket but suddenly i did something different i almost never do (openness improved) that is to “perceive” the hq shopping cars that are better than the ones i only used because you don’t have to “bow” each time you purchase an item. this may sound very simple and stupid from a well functioning mind, but for a depressive']\n",

(for reference, i am now 22 years old.). this means there is always an uncomfortable aura in the house which means i can never fully unwind. i share a room with my brother and mother. the room was never meant to house more than one person and an extension, aka \"work room\" was built on to the bedroom which is what my brother and i share. i also have a grandfather who lives in vegas and hes been wanting me to live up there with him but i need to make money first, and i cant hold a job.**hobbies**: growing up, video games, listening to music, and reading books were my favorite things to do. overtime, ive lost interest in books though and i waste a lot of time on reddit these days. i also golfed from a very young age to about 17. i never liked it, i just did it because i thought my mom wanted me to do it. ive also had many random passing thoughts go by but never act on them. for example: archery, playing guitar/drums, making youtube videos, writing things, running and hiking are a few. ***jobs:*****counter/cook** - first job. held for 2 years. age 18-20. i was generally a good worker and dependable but occasionally i would show up a few minutes late. i had a good thing going at this particular restaurant and management liked me, but i quit. this was around the time i failed college. i even was rehired for a few weeks by the same manager before i impulsively quit again.**busser**-didnt get past the online orientation because i thought it was needlessly complicated, so i walked out.**cashier** (gas station)- made it past orientation but didnt show up for shifts.**cashier** (grocery store)-i made it one day, then stopped showing up.**movie theater**-got hired and didnt show up because my body wouldnt move out of the car. **movie theater (different location, current. age 22.) - finished my first shift yesterday and my brain really wants me to fall back to familiar habits and go no show again.***medical*****therapist** - started seeing one around age 19. i thought she wasnt helping me by just talking general stuff. so i cut off contact.**psychiatrist** - started seeing one age 21. depression']\n",

      "['i just need a place to vent so most of this will likely be incoherent.im 18 and a freshman in college and for the past 3-5 years of my life ive started hating myself more and more. it started out slow with just finding some of my insecurities annoying but its evolved into hating the entirety of the person ive become and im not sure i can do anything about it. im antisocial and socially awkward but ive managed to get myself into a few different friends groups, even though im fairly certain im at the bottom of all of them. i have contradicting feelings that make me question whether im depressed or just a pussy when it comes to life. im really insecure about myself and how i act and whether what indo is perceived as normal or weird. i also almost always second guess conversations and relive every mess up i have when i flounder in casual conversation, which happens a lot. i have some really good times with these friend groups but the moment theyre over i have my lowest lows where i just lay on my bed listening to music that just makes me feel worse for hours. it feels as if im simply a spectator to life, where even though i have friend groups im often not invited or told about some events, or im talked over, or it just feels as if its unnecessary for me to be there. i think about death and wanting to die on a daily basis, yet actively committing suicide or doing anything that would purposefully put me in danger is too active. instead i constantly think \"hey itd be awesome if i could be diagnosed with some rapid fatal disease\" or \"god i really hope a truck comes out of nowhere and t-bones me when i go through this intersection\". im at a point where i dont think ill ever commit suicide, but i also dont fear death and find myself longing for it. i think there are people who care about me, mostly family and relatives but i can tell that im often a burden to them or frustrate them because im total assholes to them. i no longer am expressive towards people and often do the bare minimum to the point where i rarely even say \"i love you\" to my family members and only do it when i think im supposed to and not because i want to say it. i was doing research and im not too sure if i have schizoid because ive become pretty emotionally distant; most of the time i interact with people or friends it feels like im either faking it or altering my personality to mimick theirs because i just dont feel things the same way anymore. i think a large part of the way im feeling is because i dont have anyone in my life that cares for me or i care for. im almost 19 years old and talking to people i dont know stresses me out, ive never had a girlfriend or any super close friends, ive kept most of my personality, feelings and thoughts buried deep inside me for years. the other night when i was hanging out with my closest friend group we were all drinking and having a really good time for the first few ours. i probably drank too much and i got really depressed, and while i know alcohol can do that to you i dont think that was it; instead it simply felt like the years of covering up and burying my feelings was undone and i got a glimpse of my extremely depressed inner self, to the point where for the remainder of the night i was just sitting kneeled up in corners hating and isolating myself. my friends saw this and tried go bring me back in the conversations but i ended up just pushing them away. my one friend even came up to me and was like \"hey lets talk, anything you want to say say it and lets talk about it\" to which i basically said \"i really wish i could but i physically cant. i really appreciate you coming to try and talk, but you should just go back and enjoy yourself, im fine\". this was just the other night and i regret it so much because we all wont see each other for a few more months with winter break coming to an end and i spent the majority of our last night in a corner depressed by myself pushing them away. that night i saw how raw and depressed i am on the inside and it honestly has scared the shit out of because i didnt think i was anywhere near that low.all in all ive just become a total asshole over the years, to friends, family, people in general and i hate who ive become. and as i said before, i dont see me killing myself but i also dont see a future past college. i have no dreams or aspirations because i know ill never get there, and it feels like im only living and doing things because im supposed to and its what people expect of me. i just wish i could pop out of existence. i realize i should probably get a therapist or find someone to talk to but ive got my feelings so locked up i just cant bring myself to do it. i also fear that if i go to a therapist or doctor theyll just tell me theres nothing wrong with me and thats its all in my head or that what im experiencing isnt what i think. i feel so empty, stressed, depressed']\n",

      "['i honestly feel bad for her, given how it made her feel.but as some of the comments say, i cant help but feel perceiving the creature as anything less than a person is ignoring the message of the film. its not that the film sees elisa as less than human, its that she sees herself that way. strickland sees her that way. a lot of the world sees the trio of protagonists as lesser than.she meets the asset (a dehumanizing title for the creature; elisa calls him a him whereas most other people call him an it) and she finally falls in love with someone who doesnt give a shit about her disability. she simply is. she is her best qualities, her love of music and life and her exuberance, her innocence, her warmth. she isnt her disability. shes elisa. and hes in love with her on a primal elemental level.strickland sees both the creature and elisa as being less than human. his worldview is that were made in \"the lords image\" and that one such as him, free of physical disability, is closer to god than one like elisa. when in truth, it is elisa thats worthy of the assets love, the gods love, and in a less direct sense, giles as well. its the content of our hearts and who we are that make us worth loving. to see the creature as lesser than disregards the message that humanness is more than physical conditions. strickland may be humanized but hes still the films greatest monster. he gets off on the silence of women he can take advantage of, hes merciless and limited in his perspective. nobody is a total monster in every facet of their lives. but he is ultimately percieved as a pitiful figure. a squirming specimen, lower than the creature not because hes disabled in body but in soul. he is filled with hate, living the lie of the american dream, a dream that disregards the marginalized. the creature is true to himself. stricklands food of choice is hard candy. completely and totally artificial. the creature? eggs. life. there are no false appearances to the creature. what you see is what you get. accept it or dont because it is something you cannot change.i understand how the dance scene may come off even more problematic but keeping in mind what she sings (\"youll never know how much i love you...\"), i think its less \"i wish i could sing\" or \"i wish i wasnt broken\" but rather \"i wish i could tell you how much you mean to me.\" those of us who have found love, true love, will know how difficult it is to properly express how far our love goes. in this case, a case where her beloved speaks neither english nor asl, it only becomes harder to express that love, that passion. and so the creature quietly eats his egg, unaware of how much he means to elisa. that alienation manifests in fantasy; the fantasy of communion through song and through dance.i can only speak from an able-bodied perspective, though. my afflictions are mental, depression and add. i cant relate to the physical elements of disability. i can however relate to feeling less than a person.i will end on this note, however; there is a person in my life who is willing to love me regardless of such afflictions. he supports me in pushing against my depression']\n",

      "['i believe a big part of depression is self forgiveness. i’m obviously no therapist nor am i a statistician by any means but from talking among mutual depressed friends, i came to a conclusion that among our bad self image, we tend to torture ourselves with memories and think back about moments where we felt humiliated, regret, rejected etc. and we bring those things into our present sad mood. the tip is to realize experience and negative moods as separate entities. its a way to reprogram your brain to practicing letting go and self-forgiveness.your experiences(things you did, choices you made, people you have met, accomplishments/failures etc.) are what built who you are today and what got you where you are now, you are probably wondering“but these are the things that made me depressed now??” but just bear with me here:these experiences by no means define who you are as a person! people are always capable of changing, they just have to choose to start and to trust. look for a place to forgive yourself for the shit you did back then or the grief you went through. the big picture is that these experiences are lessons that either strengthened you or taught you an important lesson. you will never repeat the same mistakes you constantly think back about and eventually when allowed enough time to, you will fully process that grief. pain has a shelf life so don’t let anyone tell you to hold that shit in. we are not sad simply because of the choices we made and what happened to us in the past, we are sad because sadness just simply is, just like happiness, the world, negative/positive and everything else. we stay sad when we keep telling ourselves over and over again that we fucked up and we think something is punishing us when in reality we are punishing ourselves. i’m still battling depression']\n",

i found a girl at my work that was worthwhile, someone i could literally see myself with. have you heard the saying, if your patient the right girl will come to you...well, she was the one for me, the girl ive waited and looked for so long. she literally had every quality i wanted from a girl, sincerely nice, outgoing and fun. i changed so much for her. i got back into shape, i started dressing really nice, i became so much more confident, funny and witty around people and i went back to finish college and even got my first real career job as a software developer just to prove to her im not a loser. in someways, it helped made me become the cool, confident person i always wanted to be and envisioned myself to be when i became 21. basically, i felt like i was at my prime and i thought that everything was going into place, this was the fantasy moment i always envisioned.she took notice of my change from that quiet shy guy to the new person i am now, and me and her got close for the past few months. we never kissed or held hands but i definitely felt some small spark and unlike other guys shes been with, she didnt mind the occasional kiss on the cheeks here and there. she is touched with the things i do for her and we would spend hours together after work. i would help her with work off the clock, comfort her when she was down and do just anything to make her happy.... she would drag me everywhere and she says my name in a certain way that just makes my heart melt. she was the first girl i ever felt being fully comfortable being just myself around. i thought this was a sign.... i just needed that one break, that one chance to prove to her that i am an awesome person that wont hurt her like her ex did to her.....i never got a real chance, i was shot down even before i could ask her out on a date...a real date with just me and her and not a group thing with her friends....she told me she did have some feelings for me, but she said shes afraid it would never workout. she said she doesnt want to lose me if it never works out....she was sincere about that but i knew the other big real reason. she is still hung up on her ex. she always told me she was over him but when a girl says shes 99% over with her ex, you know she is totally not. the ex works right next door and would always come over to her and try to patch things up with her. she never gave me a real chance because she still loves him....and im left in the dust, heartbroken, a \"friend\" in her eyes and at best a plan \"b\".....i dont talk to her as much anymore as i just wanted my feelings to die at this point....talking to her would just bring those feelings back...and i dont want to go back....the pain was already too much the first time...i became so fucking depressed. this wasnt the first time this happened to me, ive had girls do this to me before, but i didnt take it too seriously cause i wasnt really very close to those girls. but i felt so sure about this one....it was the closest ive ever been to a girl and the closest ive ever been to getting a girlfriend and for the first time ever, i truly felt the \"spark\" i always hear about from relationships. it hurts even more that despite my brain saying to just move on, my fucking heart keeps on trying to find any excuse to try again. i feel awkward now because sometimes the new coworkers comment on how i am. some are flattering, like they say how im pretty cute but others say i look like a fuckboy or a chad. its just a reminder of how much i changed. they judge my appearance and demeanor and thought i be the type to have a girlfriend but really i am a socially awkward loveless loser...and them saying that only makes me feel so fucking fake...of how much i changed for someone that never truly had the same feelings back...one things for sure, i dont think i can open up to another girl anymore....atleast for a while....now its just wallowing in my sorrow of being so alone in this fucking world....i just want one fucking chance....why is it so fucking hard to give a guy a chance....&#x200b;tl:dr;  i never had a girlfriend. every rejection pushed me to better myself in someway. recently met the girl of my dream. i got back into shape, i started dressing really nice, i became so much more confident, funny and witty around people. she was interested in me and i was in love with her, but she wouldnt let go of her ex. then she rejected me and said she liked me as a \"friend\".....biggest heartbreak ever. now, im depressed']\n",

      "['i have been fighting depression, add and anxiety pretty much since i was 12--im approaching 50 now. the roots of these diagnoses i suspect are deep in my parents early divorce, probable attachment disorder and intermittent emotional neglect and psychological abuse.  i was diagnosed at 16 and had some good luck with anti-depression meds at first.  my mainstay coping mechanisms, though, developed in early college:  alcohol and weed.  i did take meds intermittently, but never felt great about big pharmas game and the results were so mixed that although i was often using anti-depressants and stimulants, i mostly tried to self medicate, plus drinking and getting high were socially acceptable and encouraged in my friend groups.  i also fell in love in early adulthood, and 18 years later i’m divorced with a (now 10 year old) son.  and although we had a good 12 years, the final years of marriage were awful.  the sobriety of parenting together undid us, and i firmly believe it was in no small part because we no longer were able to numb out on booze together.  plus i was not able to get it up (thanks years of weed and meds!) which of course did not help the reduction of intimacy that often follows a first child.  years of resentment boiled up as we proved to be more and more out of love as our beautiful baby became a boy.  my ex dealt with our dysfunction by sleeping with my trusted “friend”. the ugly end of literally the only beneficial family relationship i had left, that seemed unshakable only years before, also happened at about the same time as my career collapse, something that also seemed unlikely.  in that same year my marriage shattered, i had to walk out of the elementary classroom i taught to be tried before hr for the decline of my abilities, only to lose my composure so entirely that i had to go home mid-day without even saying good-bye to the students.  i went on long term disability the next day for my mental state and never returned to that school or classroom teaching.   my son’s age at the unraveling of our relationship, being almost identical to my own when my folks split, caused any healing i had done from that trauma to explode and fester.  i was going through all this as we marched through the stages of pre-trial divorce.  at the time i was given more and more meds to help me through, and i kicked regular substance use entirely, dropping decades worth of friendships (built on substances) from my life.  now it is almost 6 years later and i have had some successes (reduced my meds, still living without substances, steady employment) but have very little to show for a life at my age.  yes i am a consistent and loving dad (i know that is not a small thing, and i’m proud of that) with 50% custody but my income is just barely enough to allow me to live in the gentrified neighborhood my son knows and loves, that is near his mom, his school and his friends.  i have a career i can handle without having to be on tons of meds (nannying for a wealthy family) but i do not have any growth opportunities there, no prestige, no long term plan, no benefits, no retirement.  i am living paycheck to paycheck.  and even though i did have a positive relationship after the divorce for a couple of years, i am alone now and after a year of online dating and some near misses, i feel like from the outside i am a man without a future, without money, without an extended family and without ambition (beyond not being depressed).  although i look pretty good, i have persistent foot pain and low energy. i feel like i stink of mid-life collapse and i am losing faith that i will ever be able to attract anyone who can help me be the person i am capable of being, someone that i can love and be loved by.so back to my question:  since my sobriety and recent reduction of medications (this past year), i have become much less numb to my pain and tragic history. i am feeling all the feelings. as i have made my life smaller and more manageable i have tried to confront the feelings that drive so much of my inner conflict.  i have delved into many books, self-guided classes and attempts at living a more healthy life.  i have gone deeper into psychotherapy than i ever could have on all those meds, but i am so deflated and tired  from the depth of the lows, that i wonder if really feeling my feelings is going to help me anymore.  i have been able to find a few core things that i can tell really do help me (yoga, exercise, journaling, low-inflammation dieting, meditation) but i cannot seem to make any of them actual habits.  it’s hard to take on new habits alone, with almost no community and little discretionary income to invest in myself.from reading and listening to lots of books (on attachment, psychology, self-help, mindfulness, etc) i have been left with the overriding feeling that addressing my problems starts with developing good habits.  that if i only improve my character by developing better mental toughness then i will no longer live my traumas over and over again, and i’ll be able to use self-discipline to move on and contextualize my past so i can thrive in the present and future.  my therapist sees encouraging signs in our sessions, but my psychiatrist is very concerned at my plunging scores on depression']\n",

      "['i recently graduated high school and was dating someone for three years at that point. i believed myself to be happy, i was getting good grades, and on the surface i seemed like i was successful. i didn’t get into the university of my choice, but i was offered an opportunity to reapply if my gpa was high enough. at my graduation there was this girl i had started talking to from one of my classes. she was a 10/10, but a lot of people i knew didn’t like her because of what one of her ex’s says about her (that she’s crazy and a whore). i offered her some help early that year dealing with some of his crap and we became friends over it. everyone was hugging so i felt no shame in hugging her too. about a month later i broke up with my girlfriend. it took me 3 years to realize the whole time i was being emotionally abused and drained to the point my family noticed a complete change in my happiness. i went to drink the pain away, and instead of drinking alone like an idiot, i wanted to drink with someone that understood the pain i was going through. i texted her and she said yes, but she would have to sneak out. enter one of the best nights of my life and the start to the most memorable summer ever. we started dating two or three weeks later, after i was one of the few people to ask what happened to her when her phone went dark (she had gotten in serious trouble from her parents, no cell), and immediately fell in love with her family and her. she broke me out of a shell i had no idea i was in. we were sporadic, doing things on a whim. i had always wanted to live my life on a “why not” basis, and that was the only way we did anything. we would only plan for bigger things, occasionally throwing them out for better ones. in the summer she allowed me to experience what it meant to have fun, and to enjoy life. fall hit her hard though. she has so many problems from her dad leaving her family, one of which is seasonal depression. when i went off to college, we tried to make it work. she started to exist on seeing me on that once a week schedule, me being the only one to make her feel happier and fulfilled. meanwhile i had so much trouble adjusting and taking the pressure. i cut for the first time just before i left, and cut again later in the semester. i was disgusted with myself, but for some reason i still did it again. one night i nearly put a knife through my forearm, and another with my girlfriend, had a panic attack while drunk. she forced me to seek a therapist, and without that i likely would have been making this post. i cried on the way back home with her, and she was right there for me, realizing how fucked up i was. to say that it was all perfect though would be an oversight. we did break up during the semester and she did see someone for a one time thing. i decided not to hold it against her because of what she meant to me, and because it was totally stupid on her part. we would bicker at times too, often times because i would say something stupid because of a lack of social skills and her belief that she was fragile. yet it still worked until about middle of the semester where she greened out at a party and woke up to a guy who made a move on her. that was some final straw for her, and i think it broke her on some level and we broke up for the second time. assuming she needed time to figure things out, i started talking to close friends about the incident to get their opinions. i spoke to one of them who i forgot was a mandatory reporter. for the sake of brevity, i had to make a police report, and the night i made it she got a phone call from the local police department and the next day three officers showed up in her school. she screamed at me, but i knew what was at stake and what i had just done. her family lived on a knifes edge, and she was trying to repair her relationship with her mom. her friends could have started asking questions, possibly leaving her. her freedom became questionable, as she was getting high again, which was the reason in the summer she had got in so much trouble. but nothing happened. and i had to fix this. i hadn’t played piano in 10 years, yet two days after she screamed at me, i began again. in 10 days, i learned the song that symbolized the entire thing to me. i originally gave myself a window of 14 days, but i was ready. i recorded it and sent it to her, with the best apology i could have come up with. “it’s beautiful, but it doesn’t change anything.”and i knew that. but again in vain i still tried, i promised myself i would be home for her birthday so i was. i had already started on her gift and gave it to her. i just wanted to have a true conversation with her about all of this. to get closure and to understand what the future would hold. i have her my gift and asked her to talk to me, so we did. we talked for two hours. it came down to us being fundamentally different people, but agreeing we were each other’s best. that we could not be friends because the feelings would be to great. that we should try to move on from each other, and maybe decades down the line reconnect. when we hugged as a final goodbye, my throat hitched. she pulled away and put her hand on my face. she realized what she did immediately, but that was the moment that i became me. that i started to close off again.it was like this until she wished me happy birthday. she was the only one to do so, because i tell no one about it. but even my best friends didn’t say a word, so it meant something to me. i’m hindsight it was rather innocuous, but i dwelled on it for a little while. then walking through the city with my family it happened for the first time. i was looking at christmas lights and i saw us. laughing, looking up at the lights, holding each other. i blinked and it was gone. those moments have been happening occasionally since, in places that meant something to me or to us. i will see us in the perfect instagram ready photo, and it will ruin me for the day. i’ve tried my best to move on, got a tinder, started talking to as many people as possible. nothing works, and i realized it’s because i’ve been given the gift of caring for others: not flirting. so i’m going to delete my tinder and make sure that i’m not so stupid moving forward. about a week ago, i noticed her instagram post were getting progressively more depressing. she blocked me and unblocked in a span of 12 hours. i decided to say something, not as someone wanting her back, but as someone who was genuinely concerned. she said she was fine, and we texted until i got a one word response. now to summarize: we have the girl who broke me out of my shell and helped me experience life. who probably stopped me from someday killing myself. who was the one who taught me what true love really meant. and that i ruined in one action, to destroy any future chance i had. what i want now is what i wanted two months ago. i want this fixed, and i want to be able to hold her again. i decided this january i would think about making another attempt to reconnect, but if it seems too much i won’t. i really think it’s done and over with. i don’t need to hear the crap about “there’s so many other fish in the sea.” i know there are. but how many fish do you believe you owe your life to? that you think about every night? that you sometimes cry yourself to sleep over?if i had the chance again, i would live my life to the fullest with her. i’d change my dreams based on this one delusion. and i’m not sure if the world would agree with me. i just needed to put this in writing. if you’re still with me, am i crazy? i already know i’m depressed']\n",

      "['i guess i just need to get it off my chest. i think im depressed. i say i think cause ive never been diagnosed or sought treatment for depression in particular. im 22 now but ive been dealing with body image issues since i was 11 and the bulimia from sophomore year of high school. that was around the same time i started self harming. but no one could tell-i made sure to hurt myself in places covered by clothes and i still kept the same cheery demeanor i did everyday. i had good grades, a small but stable group of friends,  sports, played in the marching band. never went to a party. the ideal, boring high school student. my family had some issues, mainly between my brother and my dad, but i tried to stay out of it and be the dutiful daughter. doing chores, watching my siblings, listening to my parents. the self harming curbed as i was about to go to college but my eating disorder got worse. got to college and my first 2 years were pretty rough academically. skated by on natural talent in high school and realized that doesnt fly in university. ignored my grades and just tried to socialize as much as possible and started restricting my diet like crazy and working out for at least 2 hours a day just to feel in control. dropped to 105lb (im 54). was diagnosed with adhd my junior year much to the dismay of my parents-i was supposed to be the golden child. my brother was the trouble kid with the depression, anger issues, and adhd. just got medicated never went to therapy. junior year i was in a relationship. felt like i was soaring, continued to do mediocre in my classes and when i began to crash, i tried to turn to my then boyfriend for support but turns out he would rather go out to the bar and talk to other people. we broke up at the end of the year. depended on him so much i lost touch with a lot of friends and opportunities. during that time i didnt take my adhd meds regularly. just made me feel like shit that i had to take them in the first place. senior year my stress, depression, and anxiety was even worse. felt suicidal. was vomiting everyday and my grades were plummeting. felt like i was an idiot for picking a major as difficult as computer science when i wasnt applying myself like i should. tried a couple therapy sessions at the end of the year and tried to talk to my mom about sitting in on a session over the phone and she screamed at me about how i was faking/overreacting. dropped to 94lb around this time. i was also about to take my 5th year cause i had planned my classes so horribly and also wanted to improve my gpa. i think i wouldve really hurt myself seriously if my current boyfriend wasnt there to just keep me company and be positive. still, i never told him fully what was going on. now hes in california and im on the east coast and were doing a long distance thing and hes still amazing. so loving and kind and ive let him know to a small extent my feelings of depression and i made it seem like i used to have an eating disorder though i still have episodes to this day. but things at home are getting worse and my mom and dad are fighting, my brother (20, has pretty mentally abusive tendencies stemming from anger and depression) is making things harder on my mom and i can see her starting to crack. my little sister (11) cries in secret after their fights and im the one who tries to comfort her when shes trying to get away. im at home now for winter break and im so stressed about home life once i leave and my mom has no one to help her cook, clean, or listen to her. also been stressed this past month because last semester, right before finals i fainted twice in 3 days and got concussed. felt silly the first time i fainted (during an exam) and tried to brush it off and just made a couple appointments to check myself out the next week. fainted 2 days later, hit my head harder. concussed. still have headaches and my mood has been even lower but i still have to study. yet, im still trying to be supportive and happy for my mom. trying to help around the house while studying for the exams i couldnt take. trying to build a better relationship with my brother and help him even when he hurls abuse at me, not that thats always. trying and trying but not feeling like im making any progress. feel like im a failure. ive always \"joked\" for the last few years i wasnt gonna make it past 30 cause of stress and the fact i get sick all the time. been saying that a little more often and my boyfriends picking up on it and hes starting to get concerned but now im doing my best to cover it up. last night, he called me and i joked i wanted to die. but for a bit i didnt know if i was joking. i wasnt even sad anymore. just reached a point where i didnt feel anything and just thought of how i could kill myself-obviously didnt act on it. just told my boyfriend i didnt much want to talk about what was going on and went to sleep. i dont know if this is dissociation but i can imagine myself being gone without feeling much right now. and at the moment that doesnt even scare me. just wanted to get that off my chest. &#x200b;tldr; i look happy, successful, healthy, and smart but im dealing with an eating disorder, family issues, post concussion syndrome, academic struggles, and what i think is depression']\n",

(some background, me - 14, sister - 17, friend - 15) i felt so scared that she wasnt responding even though she was just asleep. i was breathing hard and shaking at work when i had nothing to do. i felt so pressured as well.* the company i work at (small little sandwich shop) has a jacket that i can wear if i get cold. i only wear it to cover up my arm because i dont want people to see my cuts. i had to wash the dishes and my boss said that i have to take off the jacket. i told her that my cat scratched me. she told me to show her and i did (it was one cut on the top of my arm, all the other cuts are on the other side of my arm). she asked me if i was okay and how im doing. i felt embarrassed but also comforted because she cares about me a lot. * i forgot to take my anxiety medicine today so it just hasnt been the best. i wish that i did this morning because today probably would have gone better. that is it from today at work, nothing else happened. if you did decide to go and read the other post i did, i did mention that i wanted to cut myself. and yes, i did mention that i do in this post. i found some sharp blades from a little handheld knife. the first time i cut i did not go very deep, just a few little scratches. i was clean for 2 days before i did it last night because life just has really gone horribly for me the past months. life just is not that good for me right now. i also mentioned that i was going to get a therapist and that was supposed to happen about a week ago. my mom is in new orleans with her friends (again, if you read the other post, i said that she goes out with them a lot and it has made my life not great). last weekend, when i did start to cut, she was gone and i couldnt talk to her, i didnt have the friends i talk to now whenever i want to cut. they do support me when i want to cut and they always at least try to convince me to not cut. it only works sometimes. most of the time, it doesnt work and i still end up cutting.i ate dinner last night. i went out with my friends to target and got a stomach ache. that is the very reason why i dont eat dinner, i get stomach aches whenever i eat dinner. i hate it so much. we were having such a good time then i just randomly got a stomach ache and kinda ruined my night. but it did eventually go away and my friends did make me feel better. something completely different from what i was saying, but i realized that i hate myself. i hate that i need so much attention and reassurance. i hate that i need to take medicine for something that so many people in the world dont even have to worry about (ironic). i hate that i cut myself when there are obviously so many other better ways to deal with depression']\n",

arranged marriage or tinder. so lets talk about an arranged marriage. i have to tell my family background to the family of the girl before i get to see her. and i live in seattle. it should be safe for me to not disclose these details and still be a nice person. because my family is composed of simple village-dwelling people. my parents are the sweetest people in the world but they are not successful, they dont have any accolades to show off. they still say that me and my brother are their biggest achievements, i mean the kind of people we have grown up as. they wont qualify any screening test and so wont i. now lets talk about tinder or neo-dating. im brown, im fit but im not athletic. im decent looking but im no rockstar. i write nice messages to everyone on okcupid. i do feel frustrated at times but i still am not rude to anybody for their choice of not liking me. i get it. but where does that put me? three years. not a single good friend. and its getting worse. i have lost my energy to want to impress people. and neither do i expect this from someone. i know im not a 10. i usually dont message anybody out of my league. the only people i dont message are people who i am not attracted to at all. and i guess the people who reject me are coming from a similar position. but it essentially creates capitalism out of dating. i dont want sex. i dont want anything hot. or a person who hikes. i just someone who likes me. and i would genuinely try to make it work. i wont reject someone because they dont have a wanderlust or if they are a recovering alcoholic. do other people see dating in this way? in my experience, a lot of us dont.i meditated. i wrote my journals. i read amazing books. i watched amazing shows and movies. i learnt to make music. i learnt to appreciate all kinds of music. i became well versed in philosophy. i am on my journey to become fairly well versed in psychology. i got healthy and i ran for miles. people say that im intelligent and creative. but at the same time, i got a pornhub premium subscription. i have smoked weed almost everyday for the past two years. my career makes no sense. i developed a bit of an eating disorder. i broke up with my best friend and my girlfriend. i want to go back to india but where exactly? thats a shitty feeling you know. the home no longer exists. when people tell me that im intelligent and creative, i think they are just saying it. they dont mean it. i see that the problem here is with self-esteem. i see all my problems very clearly. i still cant fix them. my hands go automatically to weed, then to my penis and then to pornhub. i constantly lie to myself and also to others. thats the depressing']\n",

      "['i can give is to get help from mental health professionals. if youre sick you go see a doctor. if you think youre going to die you check into a hospital. mental illness shouldnt change that. but dont expect it to go away over night just because you got help. and dont think that all medicine is the same just because one type didnt work. you might have to go through half dozen different medications (and maybe more than one doctor) to find one that works best. each one taking weeks to find out if its having the right effect. if youre having negative side effects speak up and dont rule out all medications. depression is an illness and not one we know a whole lot about. some times it goes away. some times you have it for the rest of your life. as for living with depression, the best suggestion i can give is to think of it like pain management. not all depression is the same level of pain. just as there is a major difference between the average headache and a full blown migraine. but even if its not a migraine if you have it everyday and its effecting your quality of life its not to be taken lightly. if you know someone with depression then you should know that person is in pain. give them support as best you can. just checking in to see how theyre doing can mean everything. if you have depression']\n",

(i wish i could see a doctor or therapist, as well; however, my parents blow over every request i make to see one, since either a.) its a waste of money or b.) mental illness is all in your head).going back to my brother, he had an hour long conversation about my attitude and my depression']\n",

      "['i just can’t bear it anymore and i have no one to talk, and this is why i’m writing this right now. at this point, any feedback can be really meaningful. this is my first large entry on reddit. it is really hard to summarize everything that happens in my messed up head, but i can try.i don’t have many memories until i was 8, except for the fact that i was a fully happy child, always kinda quiet and reclusive, but plenty happy. i had a lot of friends and family attention, i had lots of dreams, but everything started to turn in december 1, 2001. five days before my 8 year old birthday, my dad dies. it was a really rare disease, i can’t even name it (and for some reason i really never wanted to know exactly what it was). but all i remember was seeing my old man, who was a physical educator, getting weaker and weaker. as a child who have never had contact to death, i wasn’t understanding it very well. all i knew was that he was going to be ok. that didn’t happened. he was my role model. but who could tell that 2002 was one of the best years of my life? i felt so warmed by all of my family that moment. it was a rough time for everybody, but we united. i remember every night sleeping in the same room with my mom and my little brother. i felt protected. our grandparents really helped us financially (and still do, as they paid mine and my brother’s college). but, in 2003, my mom met my stepfather, and, from there, things just became worse and worse.  i had no problems with him for the next 2 years. i kinda liked him. he was not my father, but i liked him. we used to play soccer games together in the ps2. but after some time his attitude changed. he became more… explosive?i was becoming a teenager and i always had something of a dark humor (not the racist/mysoginist/homophobic shit, but still dark humor). one day, he almost broke up with my mom after i made a joke calling him poor (he always had this strange money obsession, he really thinks he is rich, but we are just middle class). as a kid i was really confused with all of that, but that escalated. one day, going to the beach for the weekend, i got spanked in the car by my mom as my stepfather cheered it while driving. the motive was another joke that i made, about my stepfather shitting his pants (yeah he used to do that and leave the shitty underwear behind the bathroom door). that day was too much, too much for me and still terrifies me when i remember. i had never got beaten until that day. my cousin and my brother were in the car too. nobody did nothing to stop that.from that day on, my relationship with my mom went in a downward spiral of beating and shouting. for anything. the result? bad grades, isolation, tries with tobacco, alcohol and marijuana (at 13, 14 and 15yo respectivelly)... the whole family structure tumbled down. even today, i can’t communicate properly with my mom since i evolved a serious blockage. i don’t speak to my stepfather for more than 10 years, even living under the same roof. and it fucking messes with me.but, besides the experimentations with drugs and stuff, my teenage years were kinda normal. out of my house, i was a pretty confident person. i still had many friends (maybe not the best guys, but still friends), i had 3 girlfriends between 2008 and 2011, doing good enough to enter the journalism university… life was going on but, still, something was growing inside of me.my university didn’t helped a lot. i didn’t made any friends. it was not a campus, but just a cold, grey, boring building just downtown (still, academically, one of the best journalism colleges here in brazil). but after that, i got a freelance job at one of the biggest newspapers here in my state, so i thought the objective was accomplished.but i couldn’t avoid the troubles in my house, that kept going. so, in my time with my friends, i was really into drugs and alcohol and i spent several years in this. i feel like it was a time bomb, and, one day… boom. my first panic attack. it was a time that i was into cocaine and using it pretty much, every week. after that, i haven’t touched any synthetic drugs, even though i’m still pretty addicted to marijuana. one month after, i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. things were never the same.i got treatment, i got therapy, i had medicine, i tried to exercise, i tried to stop smoking pot and cigarettes. i tried pretty much what people tell us to do, but i failed in everything. from then on, every shit that happened to me seemed to hurt like 10x more. i broke up with a lot of people since then. even with all of this, i always tried to help my friends, all of them have similar problems, one of them even told me i saved his live with support during a anxiety attack. but i feel like nobody give a fuck about me. nobody ask how am i doing. nothing. not even a message.i got dispensed from my job after disagreements with my toxic disgusting fucking boss. and, last year, i decided to take my money and make my first travel outside the country, just by myself. surprisingly, in the middle of the darkness, i had the most legitimate moment of happiness i ever had. i spent 1 month around the coast of california. the 3 weeks i had in san diego were just magical. i met so many wonderful people and felt so welcomed. but, as it ended and i found myself in my mediocre life again, my happiness ended also.it has been rough, rough times. in the last 19 months i lost everything. at least, the little i still had. i broke up with basically all of my friends. i lost confidence. i feel like i can’t get outside my bedroom without being anxious. i’m terrified by panic attacks. i started to fear life and the outside world. i lost all interest in hobbies i once had. i lost my family because, in my head, my stepfather stole it from me. i lost the job i still had because of depression']\n",

(same thing with relationships but thats another story altogether...) my experience has been the opposite.i always knew what i wanted to do with my life. since i was about 10 or 11. its difficult to have discovered your passion so young (or at all, i believe). its funny how certainty can breed frustration in that way. everything else has changed entirely - even my very body and mind - except for that one thing.it can be comforting at times, for sure. sometimes when im surrounded by turmoil it can be nice to listen to the songs i loved when i was young. its effectively just like stepping in a time machine and travelling back there but without having to deal with all the painful parts of the past.im grateful for that indeed, but as i said, its hard having a constant thread in life. its exhausting and very often disappointing. being passionate about something (or some*one* for that matter) makes you really vulnerable to being hurt. im not just referring to criticism, be it internal or external... its like being naked and exposed in a way. its as if you have no way of covering up or protecting yourself because that would be to erase the fact that you are passionate. its kinda like the end of the trial - pink floyd. having a passion or enthusiasm for something is like the judge and the crowd yelling \"tear down the wall! tear down the wall!\" but all of it being completely silent and only inside your own head.now obviously this will sound like a complete exaggeration to most. im aware of that. i dont know if this is something unique to the modern world or if it always existed, but i feel like people who care alot about one thing are alienated. youre supposed to be well balanced in your interests and if not then youre just \"weird\". nobody likes to hear about one thing for any length of time or think about it deeply. after a certain point its \"enough now\" and onwards to the next thing. and i just get the impression that everyone is always skipping the track right before the really good part starts!but anyway, it doesnt really matter what others think or say. most passionate people are their own worst critics. even if you were in a room full of people praising you, it would still be possible to feel like a failure. fulfillment can only ever come from within and its a bloody difficult thing to achieve.i know that the only way to do that is to accept what you have and what you are. gratitude is also helpful, not just for the blessing but for the obstacles too. but why is it so hard to be supportive of and encouraging to myself? it comes so easily towards others, what makes me different?i know that thats a pretty standard experience in depressed people. i have made alot of progress in encouraging myself in other areas of life. however when it comes to my main interest i still struggle to feel adequate and worthy.i think one of the main reasons is that most people often put their younger selves down and dismiss who they used to be. theyre too afraid to empathise with their past selves. instead they call them naïve, immature or just plain stupid. but i dont do that. not anymore at least. i can laugh at my younger self, definitely! but i never belittle, insult or demean my past selves. theyre still a part of me after all. back then i did the best i could with what i knew at the time and i have to respect that.i feel really good when i notice something that would make my younger self feel proud. each time that i accomplish something that i only ever dreamed of doing before, it just fills my heart right up. :) thats why i trust the instincts i had as a kid. after all i did, amongst some other things, have fantastic taste in music for a 13 year old.if that little girl could meet me as i am now, i reckon shed think im pretty cool. that means alot to me. all the thoughts and feelings in my head right now would make no sense to her whatsoever. shed definitely love my tattoo as well. i definitely feel a sense of responsibility to make her proud because i had a really difficult, really shitty childhood. my depression']\n",

      "['i used to be happy a few years ago - was smart, funny, fit and extroverted and even had my fair share of fun in relationships. i was confident, passionate, creative, enjoyed networking and had a great career ahead. but now - career going nowhere, not even close to fulfilling my potential and losing interest in work (which means constant stress and anxiety). also lacking the confidence to make any changes, mainly because i have pretty much lost my life outside of work - no friends left, lost my social skills, and the youthful bravado, fire and passion i had before. how do i go about rediscovering my old self? how do i find some sort of joy and hope to get better in life? at least can someone relate and share their experiences? **here’s what happened:** i had a series of bad jobs with toxic work environments in the last few years. this meant extra hours in the evenings and weekends cleaning up after others’ mistakes, and even when i was free i would be mentally and emotionally drained to face my friends. i began to isolate myself and slowly my support group thinned and disappeared (i myself even pushed some away due to growing shame). i was also repeatedly passed over for recognition and promotion despite giving *so, so much* to work (to be honest, much more than what my colleagues did) and i got absolutely nothing in return. which means that today i am far short of my potential. i’m stuck in yet another job around people who don’t know much about anything (nor do they care) while my ex-colleagues have progressed in their careers to high-paying jobs and influential, valuable networks. this unfairness frustrates and demoralises me and makes me question why i’m even bothering in life. what got me through the tough times in the previous jobs was spending time with my old friends and support groups, and my interests outside of work. i kept reminding myself that it was \"just a job\", and the real joy was in doing my own things i was passionate about like startups, tech, gadgets, photography, games, and music. but i’ve got no friends or support groups anymore, i’ve even become a stranger in the interest groups i used to be part of. it kills me to realise that while my interests got sucked out by work, others who may have been less gifted have kept at it and made a name for themselves as influential in these circles. my physical fitness also has nosedived, with bad habits like smoking, alcohol, junk food, junk online content and porn. my appearance is shabby — i even skip shower and shaving some days. i’ve tried to go out and make new friends from scratch but as it is this is difficult at my age. and with my sense of humour and social skills becoming almost non-existent after going through the last few years’ experiences, im finding it near impossible to be jovial or even smile. i’ve tried online dating sites and tinder for relationships but have found no luck (i’m average looking). heck i can’t even look at a girl now due to the shame i feel when i think how less experienced and fun i might be than guys 10 years younger than me. and no, it doesn’t help to say sign up for an activity that i like doing because like i said, i’ve lost interest in most things. i can’t even seem to relax and find a few minutes to take my mind off work and watch a tv show or something without feeling stressed and anxious about my future.  i’ve thought of  changing jobs again and even saw some really good positions i would be great for, but can’t muster up the confidence to go through the job search. and besides, what if the next one is even worse? i even thought of doing my own thing outside work and network around to freelance or start something up on my own. i’m good at convincing people and selling myself when i’m inspired and when i have belief in my capabilities but my low self-esteem and self-doubt is proving to be a mental block.how do i get out of thus rut and back on my feet? how do i improve myself at work, and at the same time find hope and joy in other things before i spiral into a hole i can’t get out of? how do find joy and live happily and free of fear, anxiety and depression']\n",

      "['i was pretty miserable.  i had just moved back to my parents home after doing a 4-year stint in another city (which i did after getting out of a mental hospital, thinking that by moving away i could \"start fresh\").  i was so depressed that i could barely talk.i had just gotten back from a friends wedding in another city, where i basically drank wine like it was water and passed out drunk next to a port-a-potty, fairly early in the night.  i was sure that i was going to kill myself soon.  absolutely, positively certain.i remember my mom driving me somewhere, and she just broke down crying, saying that i needed to get a job.  i couldnt even say anything to that.  here i was, 28 years old, unemployed, living at my parents with a broken brain that wouldnt stop telling me how much i suck and how ill never get better.id tried like every antidepressant out there.  i felt like my depression was stronger than any antidepressant.  like those were for normal people who get sad.  i felt almost too smart for antidepressants, like the way that they actually work is all placebo effect and i dont fall for that kind of thing.this was like my 8th major depressive episode, by the way.  id already been hospitalized 4 times by this point.  and one of those times, the hospitalization actually made me feel better, and i came out full of confidence, which resulted in me moving away from my hometown, which resulted, eventually, in everything falling apart in a city where i barely knew anyone.  i remember crying on my way home from work for almost an entire winter.anyway, i was drifting.  i had nothing to do and i was terrified of every social interaction.  i forget who found it, me or my parents, but i read that nih in the dc area was doing a study on ketamine as an antidepressant.  id done ketamine before, and i actually remembered that it made me feel euphoric for a couple of months (after a weekends worth of use).  i called, and was accepted.so i moved up to bethesda, md.  i was in a hospital ward, but it wasnt locked or anything.  in fact, i did a lot of sightseeing, eventually.  in the beginning all i did was stay in my room and watch netflix.  i didnt even talk to anyone else.  people there thought i was standoffish, i later learned.i had to get weaned off my medications first for the ketamine trial.  that took like 6 weeks.  i didnt feel any different, helping to strengthen my suspicion that the medicines i was on didnt actually do anything.  i also got my brain scanned a few times, which involved sitting for a really long time inside an mri tube and not moving.  once i fell asleep in there.then the trial!  well, maybe.  it was an experiment where they gave you 2 infusions: one is actually ketamine, the other is placebo (saline, i think).but i got k the first time.  of course i cant say that with 100% certainty, because they never revealed which was which, but i was seeing shapes and colors and trails and was saying that i couldnt control my mouth and words were being spoken through me rather than by me.  the second time i felt nothing at all, so judge for yourself.however, even though i experienced the k, i didnt actually feel better.  i only started to feel better when they put me on zyprexa, which amazingly stopped my social anxiety.  then i started talking to other people in the trial, and making some friends.  i was still depressed but was functional.i went home around thanksgiving.  i had started running and cooking while at nih, and tried to keep that up at home.  i wasnt happy, but i was talking, and that was a start.  i was still basically a nervous wreck, but i got an interview for a coding job, did really well, and got the job (for some reason im never nervous at interviews).  i spent the first month at that job almost puking from anxiety every day, but i made some friends with the smokers, and i realized that it wasnt so bad.  plus it was easy.  plus i could move into my own place now!but i still wasnt happy.  however, one of the other people from the ketamine clinical trial apparently had wonderful results with k and started http://www.ketamineadvocacynetwork.org/ to promote its use as an antidepressant.  i found a doctor near me who administered it, and called him up.  when he heard i was in the clinical trial, he set me up with an appointment (i guess because id basically been pre-screened by the government).i got a series of 5 infusions.  each time i tripped balls.  i mean, ive done drugs, but this was about as wild as it gets.  however, it was different from other experiences, in that i felt like i could experience my mind from outside of itself.  like i could analyze it without judgement, and change it without fear.right after the first infusion, i felt a burst of energy and went running (when i got home).  the next day, everything felt lighter, easier, like it was a game.  these feelings intensified after each infusion, and i gradually thought i had a \"cheat code\" for life.this seems appropriate; its from an interview with donald glover:> glover said that he thinks of reality as a program and his talent as hacking the code: “i learn fast—i figured out the algorithm.” grasping the machine’s logic had risks. “when people become depressed and kill themselves, it’s because all they see is the algorithm, the loop,” he said. but it was also exhilarating. when he was ten, he said, “i realized, if i want to be good at p.e., i have to be good at basketball. so i went home and shot baskets in our driveway for six hours, until my mother called me in. the next day, i was good enough that you wouldn’t notice i was bad. and i realized my superpower.”anyway, that was about 4 years ago.  i now have a prescription for ketamine, which i take at maintenance levels.  ive gone through a lot of bad shit in those 4 years, but ive taught myself how to become resilient (the trick is to go through bad stuff a lot...bend but dont break).  i try to help other people by facilitating dbsa meetings and talking about my life.  i also started volunteering at habitat for humanity because physical effort is good and its good karma.my life isnt perfect.  im not dating anyone, and im worried that its a bad idea to date me because in the past ive fallen into depressions']\n",

      "['i have ocd. the rest is useful to read but you dont necessarily need to.** please, anythings appreciated. my online friend who lives a few hours away has had a hard life, depression and suicidal thoughts. shes already attempted suicide at one point in the past, although i dont know details. in her adult life shes only ever met people who have either outright rejected her when they found out she had this illness, or treated her differently because of it. in meeting her online, ive become her *only* support system for this horrible illness. she doesnt know any good irl friends, and her boyfriend, though seemingly genuinely a great guy in all other respects, has deep-seated problems with talking about mental illness. she cuts herself and although meeting me has helped her because i treat her the way she should be treated, i think she would benefit a lot from a bigger support system, and treatment for depression.the first problem with this is that shes become incredibly wary of telling people about her depression, understandably, and sees herself as nothing but a waste of space who deserves to die. shes told me that it would be extremely unfair to introduce people to her problems because she has an \"expiration date\", and that shes going to be sad for the rest of her life anyway and theres nothing she can do about it. she hopes she dies so she doesnt suffer more, and she doesnt want to make other people suffer by telling them. she has a huge discord that she runs where shes friends with all the regulars there, except they dont know. if she told them, they would completely, 100% support her, but again, see above. her boyfriend is the same problem, see above.the second problem is that she needs treatment. pills, therapy, but a) she has ocd about money, and shes poor-ish. even if she didnt think it was a waste to pay for treatment in the first place, her ocd makes it so that she has a hard time spending large amounts of money. she doesnt even look at her bank account half the time because it upsets this part of her. i have ocd myself and this isnt an easy thing to overcome. also, b), i dont know what resources she could potentially access that would be free or cheap.i will take *any* advice, help or resources. she lives in south carolina, if that helps. she and i talk pretty much all day every day except when i work, and although i genuinely love talking to her as much as we do, shes incredible in every way, i feel like the only way shes going to get better past what i can help with by being there, is if she opens up to more people, makes that connection, especially with her boyfriend, and seeks treatment. but i dont know how to do any of those things without forcing her, even though i have brought them up multiple times. these issues are too big for me alone to be able to remedy, i think, even if i can help her by being there for her in the now.please, depressed people, friends of depressed people, *anybody*, i will take any assistance or guidance. i just want to help her live the good life she deserves to live because i love her.-----------------------------------------------------------so i have an online friend who has depression and suicidal thoughts/tendencies, on top of having a hard life in the past and obsessive compulsive tendencies.im ocd myself, but even though ive never really been truly happy with my life to any degree until like this year, and ive been *depressed* for really long periods, i have scars on my arms, the whole deal, i dont believe i have clinical depress*ion*. but my reason for asking for help goes a bit deeper than that.**this will be sort of long, but bear with me please**, im sorry. i really could use some advice and resources.the situation is that i met her probably a month or more ago online through a discord. we just really started hitting it off and although i normally shy away from excessive conversation with new people i meet, ive been in a rough patch the last few months myself and i wasnt really thinking about it.the reason i try not to do that is because i have emotional dependent tendencies. ive self regulated since ive realized i had them, and they dont really show up anymore, but multiple times in my life, to varying degrees of severity, ive become emotionally dependent on someone.so we started talking more and more and since those first few days, we have literally been talking all day every day. now, obviously, this sounds fucking horrible because again, i have the history of dependency (one time it happened was literally with an online friend where we talked 100% of the time), and shes depressed.but the reason weve been doing this is because she *needs* it, from what i can gather. i learned very quickly into us talking about random stuff that she has shitty family, depression, she mentioned her boyfriend hiding sharp objects from her and i mean, hey, i self harmed before, so i offered to help if she needed someone to talk to about that, and now its a whole thing. long story short she grew up in a *horrible* family situation and was mostly isolated from anyone she could ever confide in and trust as a person. in addition to that, shes 20 and somehow every single friend shes met in her adult life has either treated her differently once theyve learned she has the thoughts she does, or left her entirely. fake friends. its *really* fucked up and i honestly dont know how that even could have happened. i feel so bad for her.the only exception is her boyfriend, who she says is a loving, wonderful person - except hes deathly allergic to talking about mental illness. she thinks this is because *his* family was/is also shitty, and hes always just had trouble with that sort of issue. it makes him uncomfortable and he doesnt know how to deal with it. i realize that doesnt make him sound like a good person at all, but i think shes self aware enough that she would know if she was in an actually abusive/bad relationship. i honestly believe her when she says hes a good person (to the degree he can be with this in mind, whatever), but that doesnt change the fact that even *he* doesnt help her with this stuff, despite him knowing. and shes too...shes not a docile person, but shes very cautious about talking about mental illness. this isnt the kind of thing she would feel comfortable bringing up again to him.*so with all of this in mind*, after knowing this girl for maybe a month and a half, ive become her *only* support system.you do not have to remind me how absolutely horrible of an idea it is for someone to only have *one* person as a mental health support system, but the thing is, i dont know what to do. thats why im making this post, and why i felt all that context was necessary.im too tired to format this better, but as an aside, *no*, i have not developed an emotional dependency on her. ive taken steps mentally to not do that and i just want to make it clear that honestly, shes just a new friend to me, who just happens to need help on a regular basis. im not going to deny her that help.i mean, this girl is *literally the nicest person ive ever met*. like, i genuinely dont even think she has any bad qualities whatsoever. shes funny, sweet, caring...shes amazing. i genuinely enjoy talking to her as much as i do. i find it shocking she, of all people in the world, could think that anything is wrong with her. i could go on for hours. shes just so pure and good.so i talk to her and be a good friend, which is really what she needs in life in general - she tells me a lot how she doesnt think im even real because im so nice, but im honestly just acting like normal me and doing what any good person would. like i said, shes met bad, shitty people, and i care about her. so when she tells me that shes not real, or shes nothing but a waste of space who deserves to die, or that shes this terrible monster whos a burden just by existing and she should just jump off her balcony right now, i comfort her and help her. or i try to. the wall im running into, which i shouldve realized slightly sooner, is that there is only so much i *can* help. i have ocd, so my mentality subconsciously is to try and straight up *fix* problems, and ive realized i have a big tendency to try and make her feel better explicitly, instead of just talking to her like i would anyone else. it isnt necessarily *bad*, but i know that overdoing it would be, and i dont want to do that. i just want to help, but even when i do my best, sometimes it just doesnt affect her whatsoever and all i can do is be there for her. we watch movies on rabbit sometimes and were planning voice chats and stuff, but.the final bit of context here is that she owns the discord we met on. its a community full of people from different places, and shes friends with practically all of them. but her isolation is in that she feels uncomfortable telling people about her depression']\n",

i miss being in complete aww, just taking in a moment of beauty.. you know what i see with a phone.. a bill.. a reminder that no one’s texted me, an outlet that means you are connected to the world, 24/7, never getting a break.. i check it.. no matches on tinder either aha why the fuck did i even sign up for that?..it comes time for dinner and we had your favorite.. cooked ham with that string bean casserole my aunt makes. it wasn’t as good as the years passed, but i think it was only because you weren’t there to remind me how good it was.. you would have psyched because i think she even added extra onion straws we’re eating around the table and i’m sitting at the head, because everyone wanted to sit next to their so’s, and there was only one chair at the end.. i volunteer as tribute, because why not? let them enjoy the time.. i know it’s not that big a deal, and they wouldn’t even mind, but things just happened that way..i think that’s where i made the mistake.. pretty much just asking to be talked to by those relatives who i only see three times a year..then it happened.. i hadn’t seen or talked to these relatives in a long time“hey dugefrsh, where’s [my girlfriend]? at her parents today? i made extra casserole just for her!”it’s kind of cliche to say especially because people say it a lot.. but it was like a scene from a movie..the kitchen becomes pretty quiet and she could tell she messed up and gave me a sad look to say i’m sorry. how was she supposed to know? it’s okayi play it off and just smile “ haha she’s doing well, her and her mother are on vacation this week i believe, so they’re out of state”the sigh of brief relief that swept over her face didn’t last long and she kept asking about her and telling me how cute she was and how she was so much fun to talk to..the line that hurt most was when she said she fit in perfect with our family..“she was perfect i know aunty”and it’s sort of my fault too i guess, i could have just told her that we’re not together anymore and been done with it, but i didn’t want to embarrass her finally my dad coughed and i told her we were no longer seeing each other anymore..play it off coy, everyone gets back to chatting and the situation rolls over.. i don’t usually drink a red wine, but we were out of white and i didn’t want a beer. i sat there at the head of the table playing with a bowl of jellybeans, and i even picked out all the black ones and put them off to the side, sort of like i was saving them for you.. i can’t believe you liked those you weirdo hahai finally had a moment without thinking about you today though.. the bruins game was on and was a welcome distraction; that and the alcohol was helpingwhen the game finishes up all the kids want to watch frozen.. i can’t do that..when i would sing do you wanna build a snowman to you and you’d laugh.. i can’t do it..thankfully though my parents wanted to leave.. as i’m in the back seat again, the pulsing of the passing street lamps make it a little hard to close my eyes.. when i’m staring at the stars, it’s such a lame, grandiose and romanticized way of thinking, but i knew they were the same stars that you were looking at.. it hit me that that was one time i was in aww.. looking at stars with you..after i finish this drink, i’m gonna try and get some rest though..if i’m lucky i’ll just pass out and don’t have to cry too long..maybe i’ll start the moving on process?.. it’s never taken me this long to get over someone..maybe i’ll try it in the morning.. maybe tomorrow will be the day i beat this stupid depression']\n",

      "['i sit here waiting to find out if i have to testify. im a survivor of adult rape by who i thought was a very good long term friend.  i have cptsd following years of neglect, abuse, homelessness, and hunger. the abuse and neglect started when i was 6 and my sister died, and it continued escalating until there was so much bitter hatred between myself and my family i was forced out at 17. i was angry, volatile, scared and had little impulse control. i hadnt processed the levels of abuse and slowly unraveled it during my early adult years. i just didnt care about my safety. i basically fled to another state where i jumped around from place to place. i made some amazing memories and some...not so amazing ones. i cant say i regret it all, but im amazed im alive. there were nights i slept with some nice enough stranger just so i had a bed to sleep in. cut to a few years later: i moved back to my home state with a boy whod been in love with me for years. he was such a good, caring friend. i thought, finally, things are changing. we lived together for two years and i became pregnant. somehow, he morphed into an alcoholic, lying to me on a daily basis, cheating on me and leaving me when i was 8 months along. it was probably there all along, and i just was too willfully blind to see it. so, i had my beautiful son and moved back in with my narcissistic mother and was a single mother for two years. during that time, i suffered terrible post-partum. when i went to a psychiatrist, i was incorrectly diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put immediately on a high dose of lithium. the side effects i experienced were beyond horrible. he refused to see me immediately when i begged to be taken off of it. i legitimately thought i was losing my mind. i hallucinated, i couldnt sleep but i was so tired all of the time. my emotions were a roller coaster. i went to a counselor to talk, and while breaking down about the medication and the exhaustion, about the abuse and the loneliness -  she determined i was suicidal even though that was never even close to being said. to be fair, she was very new and im sure i made her worried, but its hard to forgive her for what came next. i was arrested from there and put into a psychiatric hospital for a week. my mother refused to visit with my son, and i lost my job. i was force fed antipsychotics that made me hallucinate further, and wasnt allowed a xanax even when surrounded by schizophrenic patients who urinated on my clothes and threw a chair at me. let me tell you - the movies where they seem to exaggerate sane people being stuck in places like that, having meds pushed down their throat and being treated like any natural reaction is them having a psychotic break - it is too accurate. on top of everything, i was injured at work and have herniated discs in my neck, which at 29 causes me daily chronic pain. i refuse to rely on narcotics, but i cant do as much as i used to. and i used to do a lot. my energy levels are horrible and i hate the way i look. i suppose thats normal when youre a skinny teenager being told youre fat by your parents. however - by all accounts, my life is a good one now. my financial problems are working themselves out. i have an amazing husband and my son is 5 and starting kindergarten and such an amazing little ball of joy and sweetness. i have a decent job which allows me some flexibility. i have a car and a bed and three awesome cats and i dont ever have to worry about not eating. i think i appreciate the small stuff so much more now. i just... i feel so disconnected. i jump back and forth between anxiety and depression']\n",

then i realized. of course she didnt stayed close to me when i was ill: everything was going great with her. she only worried about me when she needed comfort and if i couldnt provide that because i was sick then she would \"worry\" (by which i mean making me feel guilty because i couldnt take no more). i went to live with my grandma for january cause i was super done with dying in anxiety and crying three hours per day when i wad okay, i needed a place to stay calm or i would just go insane. she helped me pack and gave me the key of the car, told me to have a \"nice trip\" and went back inside to check my brother.i went to my grandmas house crying hysterically and i didnt stop for hours. i just cried and cried until i was too exhausted and i slept. the morning after i told my ex-boyfriend that i was way too depressed to get out of bed and i couldnt see him and i was very sorry. he got angry (yeah, he was emotionally abusive as fuck, maybe one day ill write the story but he fucked me up pretty badly mentally), and i just shutted my phone up, got into bed and started writing suicide notes to my friends and my grandma. once i finished i realized that i couldnt go to the bathroom, let alone go to the top of a building and jump off.so i decide that i need medicine and i need therapy asap. where i live we have free healthcare, so i ask my mum to come with me to take the appointment with the psychiatrist. he saw me, diagnosed me with major depressive disorder and we started with medicines.my mum never asked me how it was. she never asks about medicines, my health, how im doing. the medicine arent working still and i never took that many pills in a lifetime, but she doesnt even notice that. she discovered i wad being medicated when i told my older brother about it in the living room and she reacted with a \"okay\". just an okay.i told her my diagnosis when i was hysterically crying because i just broke things off with my ex and she kept talking to me about what my father did that day that was *so wrong and shitty * she just didnt care that i was sobbing in the car next to her. what she told me? \"oh you think *im* not depressed?\"then just kept on telling me how bad she was feeling and how life was cruel to her.meanwhile here i am, all alone at 21 years of age, with basically nothing cause my parents managed to burn down every single piece of property they couldve left to us, with a broken brain since i was so little i litteraly cannot remember when it started precisely, five attempted suicides. and my mum just wants to talk about how she fucked up her own life and she feels miserable about it. after i told my psychiatrist this he told me to go live to my grandmas, because my house was way too toxic and i could never improve there. i kept staying there for a while cause i felt guilty about living my brothers and my mum alone, but then my little brother (the one that probably has schizophrenia, but nobody in my family is willing to accept the problem and do something about it) almost punched me in the face because i asked him how he was doing.i am very petite girl with zero muscles cause i hate sports, my brother has harms as big as my head basically. he couldve busted badly my face in a matter of seconds, but luckly for me i have good reflexes, so i avoided it for the most part. he bruised my face though.i told my mum what happened via text and she didnt reply. she didnt say anything. than she said that i should be patient with my brother whom is *very sick and very angry.* that was the day i moved into my grandmas house and my mum thinks it is only because i am mad at her for no reason. like my whole life revolves around how she feels and what she wants. because she taught me that i can never feel bad or sad or angry when she is, she is the important one that needs to talk. i am the one that is supposed to listen to her problems since i was in elementary school. she litteraly took me from class when i was 8 to show me how badly my father punched her in the face. im sorry for the long posts, but i have a lot of shit im going through and im basically quitting every relationship with my mum whatsoever because of this. i just need her to give me money, cause she is supposed to and she promised me and i am in uni and cannot work because of my depression (my psychiatrist basically begged me not to find a job cause it would only make me feel worst). when ill feel better i will work my butt of and be indipendent and never speak to her ever again. but the fact is that i am dropping someone that to me was my *hero.* i love my mum so much, she can be kind and amazing and she protected me when my father wanted to kick the shit out of me, she tried to raise me alone the best she could and i just cant leave her behind without feeling like i have lost everything in my life. i feel like i hav nothing and i need to build an empire all by myself without the help of anybody, while having no arms and no idea of how to build said empire. everyday i think that dying would be the best option, but i cant die, i promised my best friend we would climb mount depression together and get to the top together.i just feel stuck in life. everyone that shouldve loved me no matter what just disappointed me again and again. my mum broke me to pieces and she doesnt even care. she has two sons and a doll that she can use however she wants, thats it. it sucks. it feels shitty to know that the person that choose to put you into this world just left you completely alone and was never there when you really needed that. now all she does is call me from time to time and tries to make me feel guilty about not helping her in our house and wanting to be here to do nothing. she knows i am depressed']\n",

      "['i don’t know if anybody will read all of this but it’s worth a try even if it helps me to get it out in words because it’s a mess inside my head. in october i went to a thanksgiving dinner 30 minutes away from home to my dad’s friends house. the people that were there were me, my sisters, my dad, my aunt and uncle (whom i don’t see very often) and my dad’s friend. i remember saying to myself that i didn’t want to go. at all. with my anxiety currently, being that far away from home without a quick escape (as it was 30 minutes away) then it made it harder. i wanted to make my dad proud and actually go to a family gathering for once so i sucked it up. the drive i was anxious but still able to be calm. i didn’t eat before going and i didn’t get a good amount of sleep the night before which is a precursor to trigger my anxiety. i should have stayed home. it was too much too soon. when we go there is when the anxiety kicked in. i knew i would get asked about my mom and how were getting along and i’d have to talk about it. she left the house in the summer of 2015 after her and my dad weren’t getting along and we thought it was best she leave due to her emotional abuse and narcissistic tendencies. it did not go well. she accused us of kicking her out when her father was the one who took her out of the house. anyways i think talking about my mom just made my anxiety worse. i could feel the anxiety rising and the thoughts start. “what if i get sick here in front of all these people?” “what if they think i’m weird for having a panic attack?” only a hour there and i wanted to tell my dad to drive me home. i didn’t because i couldn’t be weak again and just go home. i also didn’t want my dad to get mad and to ruin his time like i’ve done before. i sat on the couch and had a full panic attack. people know to leave my alone when i get like this. when im anxious i freeze up and can’t talk. i can only focus on one thing like a tv show. my sisters would come up and talk to me but another thing when i get anxious is my throat feels like its’ closing and i gag. i didn’t want them to see me do this. i would just nod and pretend i was okay. i couldn’t even think of dinner and having to eat in front of everyone. i just sucked it up while i could feel myself having what felt like a panic attack then it would subside then start up and then subside then start up. like hills or mountains. peaks and valleys. the best way i can describe it. absolute hell. i felt trapped with no way out and so far away from home. i remember going to the bathroom even though i hate going in other people’s houses. praying it wasn’t a bad poop (which would lead me to think i was sick and trigger my emetophobia) it was fine so that eased my mind. i ate what i could. some turkey and potatoes with a fake smile on my face, nodding and trying to converse all while feeling like my body was exploding on the inside from all the anxiety and adrenaline. again i’d be okay for a short while then it would spike. peaks and valleys. again, best way to describe it. it was finally winding down and my dad wanted to stay longer but i said “fuck no. i need to go home now.” on the drive home all i could think about was the anxiety. i’m literally having anxiety right now typing this just thinking about it. i was scared i was gonna throw up or faint or have a heart attack. dad was talking to me but all i was focused on was my anxiety and my body. i just wanted to get home to my room. i gagged violently in the car as my throat felt tight and my mouth dry. this would happen whenever my anxiety gets so intense. it was pretty bad when i was a kid. when we got home i had the worse depersonalization ever. my room looked foreign. i felt like i was in a daze. i assume my brain was overloading from all the anxiety. this only made it worse. i went to the bathroom and changed into my pyjamas and i laid down, put my computer and tv on and rode it out. that night was when it all started. the next day i had what i call a “panic attack hangover” i felt so tired, my muscles were tense. i slept horrible. waking up every so often with my heart racing in the middle of a anxiety attack. it’s like my body was full of adrenaline still. i was happy to be in my bed and my comfort zone when this was happening. my bedroom has been my safe haven for the past couple of years where i felt safe when i was anxious. my dad made food for dinner and even though anxiety, which depletes my appetite, was still present, i ate. i was still anxious. just wanted my bed and to lay down and watch tv on my laptop with all my comfort. a few hours later i had diarrhea. cue my brain into thinking i had a stomach virus that i caught or got sick from the food the night before. i rationally knew it was from all the anxiety as the anxiety puts my digestive tract into overdrive. i knew that but my irrational brain as i like to call it, didn’t. i was convinced i was sick which then put my anxiety into overdrive once again. all i felt for the next couple days was anxiety. i was scared to eat as maybe i was sick and food would make me throw up. i stuck to my bland diet which i do when i think i’m sick when really it’s anxiety fucking with my head. slowly the anxiety passed after a week. moments like that typically do even though this particular time what with thanksgiving and how bad that experience was, usually last about a week. i had my first therapist appointment on the 26th of october. the anxiety from thanksgiving was gone. i still had the thoughts of “what if” but those were always with my when i left the house. i was excited to start therapy again. the session went good. it was really just to get to know me. what meds im on ect. i told her about thanksgiving and how awful it was. she told me that it was good that i got through it. i agreed but i also thought to myself that i never want to feel that way again.i stopped to get a bagel after and went home. went on the internet and read a book. my sister got home and offered to make us some pasta. i was so tired so i told her if i fall asleep, wake me when it’s ready. i feel asleep so fast without even realizing it. what felt like 2 seconds later my sister woke up me up and told me dinner was ready. i started to feel that anxiety dread again. usually when i take naps in the daytime i wake up a little anxious and groggy. apparently my brain thought it was time to freak out to the extreme because i felt the daze feeling and the depersonalization again. i walked down and got myself some pasta even though it look revolting because once again, my anxiety gets rid of any appetite i have when it rears it’s ugly head. i ate the pasta and turned on netflix and grey’s anatomy. i put on something i’m familiar with when i’m anxious. it’ sort of a weird coping mechanism. i don’t know. this is when it allll started.i spent the night convinced that i woke up feeling like that because i was sick. always go to that conclusion. i hate my brain. i spent all night in and out of panic attacks just like i did during thanksgiving. i thought “oh hell no. i’m not feeling like this again.” and it sort of spiralled from there. i felt everything. afraid to eat because i might get sick which caused more anxiety. loose stools from anxiety even though i know anxiety caused it but more convincing to my irrational brain that i was sick. it wasn’t anxiety. this kept happening. it all snowballed and i wanted it to stop. for some reason i started to feel like i did when i was 13. there was this one point where something like this happened that was similar. i would gag and get afraid to eat. i dry heaved over the sink. my anxiety was awful. my mom was there and she would help and cut me up apples to get me to eat. i would lay on the couch next to her. i started to say “i want my mom.” i thought she would know how to make it better. like she did when i was 13. i do not know where this thought came from. my mom hadn’t lived with us for over year and we barely saw each other. i don’t know why my brain thought that she would fix this. i do remember that when i would say something like “if i eat this i’ll probably throw up or it will come out of me and make me think im sick.” and she would always say “no you’re fine.” and that would help. i ended up fine. my dad and sisters would tell me everything is okay as well but it wasn’t the same. i’m not sure why i felt like my mom would make this better but i did.   i literally felt like i was 13 again and back in that episode i went through. i no longer had control over my thoughts and my body. i was anxious as hell and hated the physical symptoms that came form that and i wanted it all to stop. i think i broke. i was gagging while trying to eat which made me think i was sick. i got scared i was going to get malnourished and have to be tube fed. i would text my mom and she would tell me no, that’s not possible. i would get heart palpitations and think i was having a heart attack. i had a palpitation on the toilet and i was scared of going on the toilet. my stomach was a mess with loose stools due to anxiety but convinced i was sick and then fed on that i wasn’t absorbing my food and i would end up, once again as i mentioned, malnourished and have to be tube fed. i was texting my mom with every symptom i felt. the anxiety  felt like i was losing control of my mind and the symptoms of the anxiety made me feel like i was losing control of my body. i was afraid i was dying or had some sort of disease. i started looking up all these symptoms on google and asking my mom if i had this disease or this condition. i was afraid i was gonna have a heart attack or faint. i couldn’t eat or sleep. it’s like my brain stopped working. i cried. i would try to tell my sisters and dad that i needed my mom. i wanted her back home. all of us together again. they told me no. it’s not healthy. mom and dad don’t get alone anymore. were here and we can help you. mom’s not far away. i told them they don’t help like my mom does. they took offence to that. i got mad and stopped talking to them because they wouldn’t let my mom come home. i felt like a child. i felt out of control. why was i acting like this? i was still feeling all the symptoms of anxiety. still worried i was dying. this never stopped. this scared me. why was i acting like this? was i going crazy? was i having a mental breakdown? i started to do things to get my dad’s attention to see how bad i was without my mom. i remembered i cut myself after being self harm free for over 2 years. at that time i didn’t care. i just wanted to stop this anxiety. my mom suggested that i go to the hospital. i agreed even though i knew i would get traumatized. i went through this when i was 12. i had to go to the hospital and i remember sitting in the waiting room. this was back in 2002 and there was a breakout of some virus that caused vomiting. the norwalk virus i think. i remember my dad took me and while in the waiting room i kept telling him while sobbing that i had to go home. i was gonna catch something here. being at the hospital again this time brought all that back and it was like i was reliving it all again. i felt 12 again. not 27. why? it scared me. at the hospital they gave me 1mg of ativan. explained to them about what was happening what with my anxiety and me thinking i was dying or had a disease. i stayed until the morning and saw the crisis councillor. she explained that parents spilt up and it’s hard and that my mom wasn’t far and i could talk to her or call her on the phone. i felt good hearing that. i felt better. i went home and felt good. i hated that i self harmed though. i hate that i put my dad and sisters through that. i went to sleep feeling good. i can move ahead. nope.i woke up in a panic attack and all the thoughts came back. the health anxiety. the symptoms of anxiety. my thoughts went back to needing my mom again. i started acting out and throwing things to get my dad to see i wasn’t okay and needed my mom. why was i acting like this? i felt confused and scared and my thoughts made no sense. i couldn’t think or make decisions. i couldn’t calm down. i was having panic attack and i couldn’t eat or sleep. i was googling all my symptoms from anxiety and diagnosing myself with everything.i needed my mom like i had when i was 13 and this would stop. my mom decided to come over and stay a few nights. it was awful. i was till asking her about every symptom. i was gagging at food and scared of malnutrition and she kept saying no. it’s just your anxiety. this time my mom’s words weren’t helping. i’d lost control and i was going to feel like this the rest of my life. i was terrified. i stopped talking to my friends or going on social media. all i thought 24/7 was anxiety, anxiety, anxiety. what illness or disease i could have. the heart palpitations, gagging, not being able to eat, or sleep, diarrhea, sweating, shaking, scared i would faint. it was all i was focused on. i couldn’t focus on tv or movies. i couldn’t read. i couldn’t sit still. the only relief i got was when i went to sleep with the help of my seroquel. while my mom was there it was hell. i wanted to convinced my dad and sisters she could come home. she could sleep on the couch or back in her bed with dad. have it all like it was before. i dont know why i was saying this. my sisters and my dad don’t talk to my mom and her being in the house was tense for all of them. my mom felt uncomfortable there and my sisters didn’t want her there either. my mom had to go back to her parents house where she had been living since she left home and i thought “oh hell no.” she’s staying. i stopped talking and stared at the wall in hopes that my dad and sisters would see that i was bad off and needed my mom. i don’t know why i was doing this but like i said i had lost control of my mind. she had to go and i just laid there begging for them to see. i just cried. my grandparents came to pick her up and my grandfather and my dad don’t get along. they got into a physical altercation a few years prior. i heard yelling and screaming downstairs. my little sister was pissing me off. she kept telling me my mom couldn’t come home and i was being stupid. she called my crazy and all. she was yelling at my mom telling her to leave. i remember getting up and walking downstairs and i punched her in the face. i hate that i did this. we’ve gotten in fights before. we ended up fighting and my dad tore us apart. i remember just flinging myself on the hardwood floor. i felt like i didn’t know why this was happening. my mom left. i went back to my room and cried and still felt the anxiety. i started googling again. i’d post on reddit looking for reassurance that i wasn’t dying. all the while my sisters and dad distances themselves from me. i told them to leave me alone and i hated them when inside i wanted help and i just didn’t know what was wrong with me. i was scared. why was i acting like this? why was i feeling like this? was this is it? was i going crazy? i would look up the symptoms of going crazy. that night i went downstairs and told my dad i was leaving. i wanted my mom and they wouldn’t let me so bye! i didn’t want this i just wanted to know what was happening to me. i put on clothes and packed a bag and i hid in the woods hoping that would get their attention. i sat there for 20 minutes and nobody cared. i remember walking back home and i had a heart palpitation and i thought “no” i can’t have a heart attack and then my anxiety skyrocketed again. it wouldn’t stop. i was in a constant state of fear and anxiety. i felt my body and mind were on high alert. when i got home. i just laid on the floor in the living room. i called my mom over and over and told her nobody was seeing how bad i was. i was calling my grandfather to pick me up so i could go stay with them. my mom kept telling me to wake my dad up and ask him for help. i said no he doesn’t get it. my mind was set that only my mom could fix this. i went upstairs and slammed my door and self harmed again. my dad came in and shook me and screamed at me asking me why i was doing this. i didn’t know. i didn’t know what was happening to me. i just wanted the anxiety to stop. i refused to go to the hospital again and re-traumatize myself for the 3rd time. after that i knew that my mom wasn’t coming home. just wasn’t happening. i was still feeling anxious as hell and googling everything. i was not sleeping well and not eating. the anxiety was awful. i had never felt this anxiety in my life ever. maybe when i was 13 but not as bad. i felt like i was back there again. everyday i was terrified i would throw up or have a heart attack. i was having multiple panic attacks a day. i kept telling my mom i had to get out of this shit hole where nobody cared about me. (they did.) i told my dad he wasnt gonna get my rent. (i’m on disability and i do pay my rent) he got mad. i said fuck this i’m moving out with mom. she looked into it and got us appointment to sign the lease. i thought “okay, mom’s gonna fix me. i’ll feel better.” nope. while waiting for the process, my sisters and dad barely talked to me. i was still scared of throwing up or having a heart attack. i was scared that not eating much would lead me to malnutrition. i was afraid to get up and go to the bathroom or take a bath because i didn’t want to get my heart rate up or faint due to not eating much. i was constantly aware of every physical sensation due to the anxiety. i was in a constant state of it and hyper sensitive. i saw my doctor and i was gagging so hard in the office and i thought “fuck fuck why wont this stop.” he prescribed a antacid to take because the anxiety was causing this. i thought it wasn’t and i had some disease. i noticed i’d lost 10 pounds since i was there last in april. this was november. first through was “fuck im malnourished and im gonna end up on a feeding tube” i couldn’t even hold a conversation with him because all i felt was anxiety and i wanted to get out of there.going on social media made me anxious. watching a show i didn’t see before made me anxious. i started getting anxious seeing pictures of people i was friends with and pictured being in public with them and having a anxiety attack. everything was causing a panic attack. the day came to sign the lease. i was focused on living with my mom and not feeling this anxiety hell again. my mom and grandfather were coming to pick me up and the only thing i was thinking of was my anxiety. would i faint because im actively walking and i haven’t eaten? what if i have a heart attack? what if i have palpations? in the car i was focused on my chest and how it was beating. my mom trying to talk to me and me just saying things back. sitting in the lease office only thinking about if i was gonna have a heart attack in front of these people. i was not in the right mindset to be making this huge life change. i signed the lease and only cared about getting home.then something happened. i hoped that the lease wouldn’t go through because the anxiety was starting to lift. i slowly got back to eating. i could sleep. i started talking to my dad again. i felt better. it had passed.my mom texted me and told me we got approved. i wanted to tell her that its okay now. i’m fine. i didn’t. i was scared she would get mad and think that i didn’t want to move in with her. i had dug this hole while anxious and not thinking straight. what did i do? it all became clear to me that my mom is emotionally abusive and anything she does it had to benefit her. it was better we lived apart. i could think properly now. but now i couldn’t let my mom down and do what’ best for me. i told her i was excited. now i’m here. it’s been almost 6 months living with my mom in our two bedroom apartment. i walk on eggshells around her to make sure i don’t do anything wrong to piss her off. she constantly tells me that her kids don’t talk to her and my sisters are bad humans. she asks my dad to help her with money and to bring her things. she’s always asking who i’m talking to and if i’m talking shit about her to my sisters. she yells at me because they don’t talk to her and i being me, have to try to fix it. i just want everyone to get along. she gets mad if i put something back in the fridge the wrong way. her moods can be up and down. im starting to remember why she had to move out in the first place. she can’t be there for me like she was when i was 13. i didn’t realize until now that she was only there so she could look good. that she was the caring mother. when in reality she tells me to stop worrying and get over it. now i’m in this mess and worse then ever. i miss my old home. i went back there and it’s not the same. my dad has a roommate with him. the house looks different and it’s not my home anymore. the day i moved out nobody was home because they didn’t want to see my mom so i never had a proper goodbye to the house or my sisters and dad. i just left. i followed up with my doctor and ekg’s and blood tests and all normal. my health anxiety still hasn’t gone away since that time despite the doctor saying i’m fine.nothing in my life is the same anymore. i feel like a new person. somebody i dont know. i feel like i was just placed here and now i have to learn how to function. my agoraphobia has flared up again. after all the worrying about something being wrong with me is still there. i worry i still have a disease or i’m gonna faint or anything if i leave my room. my surrounding feel foreign. i feel like my world has turned on it’s axis. i don’t see my sisters because they do not get along with my mom so they don’t come over. i can’t leave the house to see them cause of my issues. i miss my dad and how much we got along. he only comes over if i need something but i hate bothering him. we barely talk. he told me that i can call him anytime and he would pick me up. my anxiety is still high when out of my room. i also get flashbacks of that time when i see my sisters or my dad. i associate them with what happened. my anxiety then spikes.i don’t know how to get past this. how did i get here? how do i move forward? i feel like i can’t move from what happened. why did i act like that? what happened? what triggered it? am i crazy? was i crazy? i miss my old life. it wasn’t perfect but now i don’t know who i am anymore. i don’t know what to do. i have good days when my mom’s at work and i’m home alone and i could take a walk or sit on the balcony but i dont because the fear of that anxiety or those anxiety symptoms will come back. i’ve become a recluse in my room. i sit on my bed and watch tv and go on my computer. i only leave my room to eat and bathe. the eating this is still scary. will i gag like i did during that time? am i eating enough so i don’t get malnourished? it’s like all my life is now is what happened in november. i have flashbacks like ptsd. i can’t move on. i’m afraid a panic attack will trigger it all over again so i have avoided doing anything that might cause anxiety or those symptoms because i can’t feel like i did then. i can’t.if somebody took the time to read all this and make me understand exactly what happened, that would help. i’m on waiting list for therapy. i went back to my dads house two weeks ago because i told my mom i wanted to move back. i spent the weekend there. my mom hated me. she told me i was a terrible daughter for abandoning her with the rent and bills. when i was at my dads i was back to feeling like i did back in november. all the feelings came back. all that happened. it also just wasn’t the same. my sisters moved out and it was my dad and some stranger. this wasn’t home anymore. i couldn’t live there. i went back to my apartment with my mom. i feel like i have no control. i feel stuck.i feel depressed']\n",

(this is the combination of anedonias \"nothing matters anyway\" and adhds \"lets flood you with a thousand thoughts and make you forget why you even had the thought in the first place.\")none of this happened. it tried to for a second, then i just said \"fuck it, this is my body, i can make it do these things\" (getting all the stuff out and setting it up), so i started doing it.within an hour i had a song, then another, then another, etc. the next day was the same, i was in chat rooms about music, talking about my hobby oh my god, its my hobby, i have a hobby, a thing i love doing!!!. sorry for the caps, but this realization hit me.its only been a week, but the effects have been stable. im not super excited and hyped up, i can just think of doing something and start doing it. and as im doing it, i dont constantly have this negative voice devaluing what im doing or sapping all the joy out of it. im not plagued by a suicidal cheer leader who wants nothing more than to make me give up and lay there till i die.i say all of this because i know what depression feels like. theres always the chance that ill have to adjust my meds in the future as one med becomes less effective or whatever. all i can say is that for the first time in a while, i feel like hope actually exists in the world.im glad i talked to my psychologist about dealing with adhd. i havent treated adhd since i was a late teen, and i only treated it for a short period of my life. had i not brought up the topic of adulthood adhd, i wouldnt have found out that an antipsychotic medication (haloperidol) could quiet that shitty nagging \"nothing you do matters\" voice in my head and let me reconnect with the things i used to enjoy.i hope whatever your method of action, please believe me when i tell you. ive spent the last 4 years of my life being absolutely certain that depressed or not depressed, joy was a lie i used to tell myself and id somehow figured out that nothing joyful was ever real.here i am, only a week later and its like the heaviest darkest fog has been removed from in front of my eye, or pulled out of my heart.i hope you find the will to keep trying to beat your depression']\n",

      "['i just want to write it down somewhere, maybe it will help. im a college senior in my early 20s. since my teen years, probably starting around 17 or 18, ive been on a rollercoaster of ups and downs, each of which usually last a few months at a time, although it varies. my initial, long ago feelings of depression stemmed from not knowing how to talk or interact with girls, having been a sheltered youth that went to an all boys high school. i went through several years thinking i wasnt good enough for anyone, feeling immense loneliness even though i had plenty of guy friends that truly liked and cared about me.well i finally learned a few years ago kinda how to get girls. and when this happened my rollercoaster went to one of its highest \"ups\" ever. i was meeting and sleeping with girls, finally. i loved it.  last year, i met a girl who became absolutely infatuated with me. she loved and adored me. she told me this numerous times. we were perfectly compatible in bed. perfectly compatible. at the point of meeting her i had already had several partners and she was the first one that made me truly enjoy sex. she desired me. i desired her. the whole time i was \"with\" her (with in quotations because i never dated her, we kinda just texted a lot and had sex on the weekends) i basically treated her like shit. took her for granted. i thought,subconsciously, \"look how much this girl loves and wants me, i must be the shit, i dont really need her cause i can get any girl i want.\" the confidence boost of having someone love me so much and think i was so attractive made me think any girl could feel the same way about me. so after about 9 months, i told her i wanted to stop seeing her.she was devastated. begged me not to go. i said no, were not meant for each other. i didnt see her for 2 months over the summer. i had no girls, and i missed her, but i was still confident in myself. i still thought i was attractive, had a lot to offer. but i missed her. i realized i made a mistake. and i texted her saying so. and she said sorry, but i wasted too much time on you, someone who constantly told me that they didnt love me, so now i started seeing someone else. so now shes gone. its been several months since then, and i havent talked to her since, besides one little hiccup in the middle where we talked for a day, but its irrelevant to this post. i still think about how good i had it, and i still miss her every day, and i always think about how stupid i was to throw it away. in the moment i didnt think i even liked her, but i guess its true that you dont know what you have till its gone. well if this was all i had to deal with, i would be ok because eventually i believe i would be able to find another girl. but over the summer, i started losing my hair, rapidly. im 22. i know this isnt stress related because 1. early onset baldness runs in my family, and 2. i started a drug to help my hair loss (which i had noticed last year before it started to get really bad) and stopped the drug because i felt like it was not working. well. my hair had become dependent on the drug, and began to really recede and thin out rapidly. so. im balding at 22. i am a tall, skinny, very pale, babyface guy who cant grow a beard and has a large skull with a narrow face. i cannot pull off the bald look. at all. i can look at pictures of myself from 4 months ago and see a very noticeable difference in how i look. i used to be a youthful looking attractive guy who got compliments from girls all the time. now i feel like an old man, in a matter of months. i have zero confidence left. absolutely none. i spend all day every day thinking about my hairline, taking and analyzing pictures of myself, going to the bathroom every 20 minutes just to see if my hair looks ok. i feel, in my heart, that my dating life is over. i feel like no girl will ever want me again. i was so confident in myself and my looks 4 months ago, and now, nothing.  this makes my regret for ending my relationship increase 1000x. i had someone that loved me for me, and was so animalistically attracted to me, and i was to her, and now its done forever. i will never have that again. and if i made a different decision a few months ago i couldve had it for the rest of my life, even if i was bald.people will tell me to lower my standards, but im attracted to what im attracted to. my standards used to be attainable. now i feel like theyre not. and my hair situation will never get better, only worse. im 22 and i feel like the prime of my life is over.all these things have led me to being depressed']\n",

(i’m biased - i like cooking.) they view the aesthetic as a way of finding catharsis - it helps (in my case) curb the feeling of loneliness when you see someone else who seems like they may understand where you’re at, or at the very least, it helps you connect with people who have similar tastes to yours.hell, it’s more of a pastel-aesthetic, but i just wore my teddy fresh sweatshirt to the optometrist today, and my doctor was *super* cool and mentioned she had the same sweatshirt - turns out her and her husband are huge h3 fans, and we might all be going to catch a drink soon!i find that the depression aesthetic helps me find expression and catharsis. but this is just my opinion. i haven’t done nearly enough reading on it, and i’m super curious on what you lot think. ——- what are your thoughts on the depression aesthetic?are people who take on the style watering down the public image of depression']\n",

(this was the summer after my 5th grade) when i got home that day i didnt want to shower because i thought a bug would fly into one of my orifices and lay eggs or something, which was somewhat justified as we had an earwig problem. i wouldnt brush my teeth because i was too worried about swallowing a bit of toothpaste and being poisoned. when i washed my hands, i kept my mouth closed out of fear that soap would splash in there, yet i still washed them excessively, and i mean like every five minutes excessively. even my moms boyfriend, who was ocd himself, was getting pissed at me. i would hoard spit in my cheek rather than swallow if i thought there was anything toxic in there. this went on for a good couple of years throughout middle school, where i was more concerned about imaginary things killing me than my grades, or at least thats how i like to justify it. by eighth and ninth grade i was a pariah, a class clown who tried too hard to make friends, and i dont remember having any.so maybe thats why i miss being in a toxic relationship. maybe if i build up someone in my mind like i did with her, i can feel happy about myself because im with her. but that wasnt the case, i constantly worried about where we stood even at the best of our relationship. she wanted to marry me, but circumstances kept us from seeing each other and i always worried what she was doing. was she seeing someone else? that kind of thing. and i was right. she got back with her ex and told me we needed a break, and that shed let me know her choice in a month. that broke me. i was so fucking miserable i broke it off with her totally, leaving casualties in the form of a big rant over the phone about the douche she was dating and all but telling her to go to hell. it was the first time i had stood up to someone like that, and it lasted. i was an easygoing guy (on the outside anyway) until my senior year, when this happened, and i spent the rest of high school in a state of...idk, not really apathy but sort of defensively. i ignored our mutual friends assuming they had all sided with her, but i did end up dating a girl we both knew. we got too serious while i was still resentful over my ex, and it was this attitude that drove her away too.months later when im reconnecting with an old friend, i learn that, in fact, a number of my friends had sided with me but i never bothered trying to approach them. fuck. i spent my last year of school miserable for no good reason, i didnt even go to my prom or walk at graduation because i thought people hated my guts. and i cant shake that feeling, i work in retail yet i get more and more dismissive and resentful as time passes. ive become cynical as fuck and its pushed away said old friend. i want to write fiction as a career and i draw occasionally, and im less and less motivated to do either of them because im always so angry and exhausted from work. im really insecure about my body on top of all that, i was pretty fat through middle school but i managed to burn it through high school and now im a twig. im not even tall enough to be skinny, i found out recently im 511 after years of assuming im at least 6 feet because of the shorter women i dated. and the dude my ex left me for is at least 62. i dont buy into redpill shit or anything but it was pretty crushing. ive kind of grown to...not idolize, but look to slasher films as inspiration to stay strong back when i was alone in school, like friday the 13th, so i could feel tough and project some kind of confidence. i fucking hate myself for having to look at fictional serial killers for self esteem. not to mention theyre mostly, if not all at least six feet tall.i dont even remember what the point of posting this was, im more depressed']\n",

      "['i spent nights crying in my room, listening to the noises coming from the other side of my door. not wanting to go to school in the morning. we moved plenty of times, i had to make new friends again and again. at one point i just couldnt care less about it anymore and chose to stand alone somewhere where there wouldnt be anyone during the recess. i felt scared whenever i thought of possibly going to talk with the group of kids there. i distanced myself from everyone and chose to stay as hidden as possible. i hated bringing myself out to people. i survived through school with bad grades and moved on to my next studies, it took me weeks to start talking with people in my new school. i remember those mornings as the bus was driving to school, how i was staring out of the window just feeling incredible sadness and i didnt know why. i felt trapped inside of my school and i wanted to get out. i then dropped out couple months later. spent couple years alone in my room just gaming as it was the only thing i could escape to from reality. since dropping out, i had been in a long-distance relationship, which lasted for nearly 4-years. i had a picture of my future, and clear goals set. for some reason within those bright positive pictures in my mind, there was still darkness. i imagined myself having a family, a big house and everything would be good, but still... the story would always end with me killing myself and i realized how i spent nights of fantasizing about suicide. i started to see what good it would bring. people wouldnt have to deal with me.. such a messy person. i wouldnt have to be a burden to my parents. my online friends wouldnt have to get bored during the conversations with me anymore. my psychiatrist wouldnt have to get frustrated with my lazy and unmotivated mindset anymore. so why wouldnt i kill myself? upon asking myself that, i cant think of a single reason. having a relationship brought me clear pictures of a successful future and gave me motivation for such, but do i really want to lock a beautiful girl down with me when theres someone else who can offer something so much better. someone whos not a lazy unmotivated worthless sag of shit like me. because after all, it all ends the same way in my head. i dont know why im writing this here.. or what am i even expecting to hear from the readers of this? perhaps more people who are just tired of me and say how they hate us young people who pretend to have depression']\n",

the worse again. we got back into the drag and the love and intimacy faded again. about halfway may she apparently had enough and searched for her own place in the city she works in without telling me. two weeks later she had packed her stuff and told me she was leaving. again she told me she didnt love me anymore and that she wanted to leave. she just didnt believe in me anymore, that i could make her happy and she didnt want to commit to me. i helped her move the next day and managed to convince her to take a break. this only lasted 3 days because i stupidly called her up in an emotional state. she got angry and then really broke up with me.i was completely shocked both times when she wanted to break up with me. for me it came all out of nowhere. i managed to see her some days after the break up to talk about it. after having analyzed all that happened the past few months, i was convinced that it was just due to the stressful situation we were in. she told me that wasnt the case. she just said she doesnt love me anymore, that she doesnt believe i can make her happy, and that we do not fit in our core. i also told her that i made mistakes, but i was mostly putting the blame on the situation. we decided to stay friends. she still liked me and i suspect she still has feelings for me because she was very conflicted and emotional about breaking up with me. perhaps those are just high hopes though.ever since the break-up, i have been a complete wreck. i cried and raged for days. i didnt eat and couldnt sleep. i got a break from my internship. i failed two exams. i felt incredibly depressed and even suicidal. i just wanted to end it. occasionally, i felt motivated. i was desperately trying to look for ways to get her back. i contacted relationship experts and bought some of their products. i also talked to family and friends about it. surprisingly, i managed to get a place of my own. my situation didnt get better though. i did have contact with my ex, but progress was slow. after a month or so i got professional help because it was all getting out of hand. a psychologist diagnosed me so far with having an acute depression. a friend of mine also suggested me a book about narcissism as he himself is a narcissist and recognized a lot of the traits in me.fast forward to now and my situation has still not improved. i still long for my ex. i love her deeply and even consider her the love of my life. i feel extremely depressed and suicidal. i also dont feel like i am somebody as if im an empty shell. i dont know what to do with my life anymore, im not motivated at all and i have constant panic attacks because i fear losing my ex forever, never getting her back. i am getting professional help, but its a slow process. i was referred to a clinical psychologist who i had my intake with just yesterday. my next meeting is in two weeks.looking at myself and back at the last months of the relationship, i have the feeling that im mentally ill. i suspect that i either have a narcissistic personality disorder or a borderline personality disorder. its hard to say though as im no professional, but there is clearly something wrong in my head. i was completely oblivious to all the signals my girlfriend gave me. i was not empathetic and i was even mean to her, pushing her away. oddly enough, i love her deeply, more than anyone and anything, but for some reason i was not able to properly express that if i even did express it at all. i feel like there are two persons in my head: the one that feels, has dreams and ideas and wants to act on it vs. the one that is selfish, mean, negative and just keeps me from actually doing things. it feels like a constant battle in my head which is often own by the latter person.i suspect that many of my mental issues originate from my traumatic childhood. my parents divorced when i was 2, resulting in a long nast custody battle. i did not get to see my dad for 4 years because my mom had used me to get back at my dad by claiming he had sexually abused me which wasnt true. eventually, when i was 6 my mom died of cancer. i was never able to love my mom after knowing she used me and im actually glad she is dead. anyway, me and my two brothers then had to live with my dad, a man that was a stranger to me. money was tight, my dad became an alcoholic, and he was constantly fighting with my oldest brother. this went on for years. all my dads attention went towards my brothers and all he cared about with me were my school results. i got into a lot of trouble at school and with authorities in my youth. ever since i was 12 i have felt depressed, never able to feel really happy. i was suicidal and self-harming. at 18 i even tried to commit suicide, but luckily failed. all my life i have felt alone and unsupported until i met the girl who is now my ex. it was such a great relationship. we loved each other so much and things went almost perfect, rarely having a fight. i could not have imagined a better relationship. i was really happy with her. though sometimes i was still feeling down, unhappy or depressed']\n",

(topic of argument: whether or not it was begging rather than asking a favour when looking for a job) i cant exactly remember when something sparked in his mind, but he just flipped at me.ive lived a relatively comfortable, sheltered life, but there has been more and more pressure to spend less time playing around and more time working with my university studies, and work to find a part time job. for the past few months i have been tossing around a few applications (all rejection / no response) and until yesterday i hadnt dedicated much time to these (i do write my resumes to high standard, dont get me wrong).basically, when my dad flipped, he smacked his hands down on my desk (rattling some parts of my pc out of place so hard for perspective) and yelled about me about how sheltered i am and how much of a spoiled brat i was. to summarise what he told me there were two things that he said, one - \"you are so close to getting punched in the face right now, and its not child abuse any more its straight up assault\", and two - \"if you want to be treated like an adult then leave home, theres the world (points out window).\"note: my dad hasnt hit me in a while, but its happened before, and hes a controlling person with a short temper and little empathy. (did hit me once when he started shouting at me) he is known to lash out from time to time, unfortunately.the world i am being forced to live in now seems like it wont end, not the good ending where you retire, but just no light at the end of the tunnel. find a part time job, work hard at uni studies, get a better job, finish degree, get a better job from 9-5, pay off debts. which reminds me, im now being forced to pay part of my pay(possibly all) - should i get a part time job in the near-distant-future as rent. i dont know if its just my sheltered self talking here but it seems a bit much to have an 18 year old already paying rent for living at home, expect them to treat university as a full time job, get a part time job, take on lots of household chores, etc. etc.im 18, ive not been properly employed per se, but have had work experience for the best part of 6 years in the same role (paid). i havent seen a therapist nor have i confided in anyone or directly implied it, nor would i ever consider confiding, but i have more than a hunch i can relate to a lot of people in this subreddit...depression']\n",

id buy 20+ at a time. after awhile i recconnected with my friends and they were using drugs; xanax and oxycontin. i told my uncle about it and he wanted to buy oxycontin for him, he said if i did id be rewarded with money and more hours at work. during this time i was also financially supporting my father, i paid for everything except his car payment, insurance and phone bill -i bought the groceries paid gas electric and water... rent too. my uncle knew that i was in this situation and used it against me, my dad is his younger brother. so i did. going out and spending thousands on oxycontin, id go back to work expecting more work and hours and hed only hand me $20, sometimes hed give me $100 but no extra hours... hed get high and just laze around. eventually he pushed me into using oxycontin as well, saying he thought i was out to get him and that hed \"get rid of me\" if he felt too threatened so i did so he wouldnt see me as a threat. he said itd make me feel better, my ex girlfriend was stalking me and messing with my car, harrassing me everywhere i went. i became very dependent on it. after a couple months i couldnt go without kratom extract or oxy, my adderall prescription didnt even work on me anymore and my boss made me give him my prescription so he could trade it with other employees within the workplace for xanax and oxycontin. there were three occasions i almost lost my life because of this; the one that sticks out most in my mind is when i met a dealer in a walgreens parking lot and he handed me an empty taco bell bag- digging a knife hard into my side, i told him to take the $500 and just leave. when i left to tell my uncle what happened in tears he stared at me and said i was making it up to steal with him, that he couldnt stand the sight of me and that if i didnt have the money i stole from him by the next day at work he was going to fire me; and reminded me of how i was taking care of my father. he cut me off and i grew very sick, i couldnt sleep, sweating shaking and never eating. he drove me to a money tree and had me take out a payday loan to pay him back; then he blackmailed me into getting him pills again.being 19 i didnt know what else to do, my parents talked me out of college and i couldnt just leave my dad and work at a mcdonalds... we wouldve been homeless im sure... a dry spot over our town came around and the only dealer in town had fake presses with fentanyl in it -i warned uncle about how dangerous it was and he said he didnt care- forced the money into my hand and told me not to come back if i lost it, stole it or was going to be empty handed- to not even bother showing up to work if i didnt have anything for him. so i got it. we did that for three weeks straight, i was so sick i didnt care and he gave me back my regular hours -he had scaled my work week down to 20 hours a week. one day in his garage we were working and he clutches his chest and i say, \"whats wrong?\" and he goes, \"weve been doing heroin the past few weeks, ive done this before, ive felt this before. go and get narcan now\". i went and got narcan but he didnt need it at the end of the day... i was robbed dozens of times with the money he gave me and he held my job over my head and forced me to pay him back either going to money tree, or overdrafting bank accounts, cash advances from my credit cards, taking out loans... i was always just doing what i was told, i needed the job...i left after i was able to quit, i got very very sick for two weeks straight and was bedridden... i took out my final loan and relocated one hundred miles away to go to school. everything was going well until my roommate became addicted to methamphetamine and pawned off everything i owned... i was in need of work again so i started working with him again and soon after (i shouldve known...) he had me doing the same things all over again. i finally told my dad after two years of hiding it from everyone and he only talked to him... my uncle let him keep this car my dad was holding for him and he sold it for $3,000 and didnt think to give me a dime... didnt even think about all of the debt he had forced upon me... my dad told me to just \"forget about it, be a man. move on\". my uncle and i no longer talk anymore. my dad hasnt done anything except tell me im weak for letting it bother me. i tried to join the military but they sent me back home because of anxiety and depression (probably caused by this, i didnt tell them).but its so hard to move on... since ive been back ive had panic attacks regularly. i cant stop drinking myself to death and my depression']\n",

      "['i attend stuyvesant high school in nyc. its the top high school there, however its also known for causing depression and suicide, which even though i never thought i would be a part of i am now.&#x200b;im super depressed. no matter how hard i work, there are always people who do better than me. i am always up till midnight working, then get up at 6, go to school without coffee, pay attention in all my classes, then go back home and do homework. yet, despite all this, im doing worse than my peers. and im not doing worse than all of them; just my classmates specifically. im in ap bio and honors geometry and everyone there beats me. i just dont get it. i am naturally gifted with a great memory that is especially great at regurgitating information, which is amazing for tests; yet my bio average is a 92, which is below the class average of 93.6. i was so proud of my 92 until i learned what the class average was. now i constantly think, \"what did i do that lost me 1.6 points?\" i used to never worry about things like that. i used to not care what others scored; just myself, because if i was proud of myself that should be enough for me. but now, i feel the need to compare myself to everyone else. everything i do now is looked at by colleges, by my future teachers, and by my peers. whenever i used to do poorly on a test, i said it loud and proud, because that was my grade and i didnt care what everyone else thought of it. now, its humiliating. i constantly find myself lying about test grades to my classmates because im embarrassed to talk about them when i shouldnt be.&#x200b;furthermore, i just failed two tests this week. two. the first one (an ap bio test) i get; i had a very very busy monday night and only got three and a half hours of sleep. even though its still disappointing ive made amends with it. however, i just dont get the second one. i took a math test today. i got 10 hours of sleep last night. i studied an hour and a half yesterday and today. i reviewed with my classmates. i ate healthy food with proteins, even though i dont usually eat healthy just because of an exam. i did everything i was supposed to do and could do; yet on the test i couldnt solve 3 of the 8 questions. i almost vomited during the test from the stress of the idea of failing the test. and honestly i wish i had, because that would have meant i could have rewritten a page or two, which would give me more time to solve it. on one of the three, i made a simple error: rather than dividing by 10. i divided by 100. on the second i genuinely could not solve it because the diagram we were given was two parallelograms layered on top of a rectangle, which made it too complicated for me to understand (too many lines and angles to know which is the correct way to solve it). then the third one i ran out of time. if i had another minutes and a half i could have finished it. instead, im now receiving half credit at best. im fine with missing the first and second one, but its just sickening to think that i didnt get the first and third, when literally every other classmate did. i asked half a dozen, and they all had the same solutions, and had no difficulty at all solving them. and its not that im dumber than them or dont deserve to be in the same class; in fact i scored higher on the placement exam. i honestly dont know why im doing worse than them, and thats whats so depressing']\n",

(for reference, i am now 22 years old.). this means there is always an uncomfortable aura in the house which means i can never fully unwind. i share a room with my brother and mother. the room was never meant to house more than one person and an extension, aka \"work room\" was built on to the bedroom which is what my brother and i share. i also have a grandfather who lives in vegas and hes been wanting me to live up there with him but i need to make money first, and i cant hold a job.**hobbies**: growing up, video games, listening to music, and reading books were my favorite things to do. overtime, ive lost interest in books though and i waste a lot of time on reddit these days. i also golfed from a very young age to about 17. i never liked it, i just did it because i thought my mom wanted me to do it. ive also had many random passing thoughts go by but never act on them. for example: archery, playing guitar/drums, making youtube videos, writing things, running and hiking are a few. ***jobs:*****counter/cook** - first job. held for 2 years. age 18-20. i was generally a good worker and dependable but occasionally i would show up a few minutes late. i had a good thing going at this particular restaurant and management liked me, but i quit. this was around the time i failed college. i even was rehired for a few weeks by the same manager before i impulsively quit again.**busser**-didnt get past the online orientation because i thought it was needlessly complicated, so i walked out.**cashier** (gas station)- made it past orientation but didnt show up for shifts.**cashier** (grocery store)-i made it one day, then stopped showing up.**movie theater**-got hired and didnt show up because my body wouldnt move out of the car. **movie theater (different location, current. age 22.) - finished my first shift yesterday and my brain really wants me to fall back to familiar habits and go no show again.***medical*****therapist** - started seeing one around age 19. i thought she wasnt helping me by just talking general stuff. so i cut off contact.**psychiatrist** - started seeing one age 21. depression']\n",

      "['my head. didnt do anything. then a few minutes ago, i cut. i have a very low pain tolerance, meaning cutting calms me right down because its too painful. but this time while it was painful, for some reason it didnt calm me down right away. but now im good. im calm. but i still wanted to get this off my chest.i am convinced that i am not welcome anywhere i go. i come from a loveless family, and my mother has said and shown many times that who i am as a person isnt someone she likes. there was also physical and emotional abuse, sometimes verbal abuse too. but now im an adult, and i moved back with her for financial reasons, and while she is a much better person (no abuse), she still doesnt like me and its obvious. and she is not the only person to straight up dislike me. i dont have friends, and people who learn about me tend to dislike me. even people who dont know about me dislike me. on this whole planet, only one person loves me for some reason, not sure why. but somehow i ended up married. but every day, i feel like he must have such a distorted image of me. how can he be the only human i have ever interacted with, to like me? okay, this thought is upsetting so im gonna leave it at that.today was really rough because i got my final proof that even at work, i am not welcome, or liked. a coworker asked for help, and i tried to help by giving her the information she was missing to come to a conclusion. two other coworkers jumped on the case, one of them said i sent the wrong information. fine. i went back and rectified my mistake. then the other two coworkers were talking about how the results are strange ... then one of them said \"hey tlzq, i would really appreciate it if you could stop writing (information) so much. x and i are trying to help here.\" (paraphrasing). and ... i dont know. am i not helping too? i made a mistake, and i rectified it. then im hit with \"stop, were helping.\" it got me so upset. its a long story, but basically many of those coworkers do not like me and its obvious. i always get passive aggressive comments from them. they always laugh when i walk by? i mean, when i worked alongside them, there wasnt much laughing now all of a sudden when i walk past their spots, i hear laughs? and whats worse is i got in an argument over personal stuff with some other coworkers who were talking carelessly about an upsetting topic (child abuse). some were for child abuse, and that got me upset. and they have been saying really rude things in general, and i told them quite frankly how i felt and decided not to interact with them anymore. so now? i am scared of them. straight up anxiety, sweaty palms, heart beating, dry mouth, the whole deal. its ridiculously irrational, but i cant help it. my office is cold because of the computers, but every time they walk past me, i feel like im suffocating and its too hot. i feel like there is a huge target on my back and everyone dislikes me.i said this on another post, but i am stuck in this loop between \"everybody hates me and is trying to make me sad on purpose so i can finally kill myself\" and \"you are so unimportant that no one would go out of their way to do anything for or against you.\" and it makes me sad either way. my husband lives in another country and we wont be able to see each other for months. he lives so far that we barely get to talk. my days are his nights. i only have my daily commute time to talk with him, which is a little less than 2 hours a day. then we both have a day off, we end up fighting, mostly because of me. ive become defensive and insecure to the point of weekly fights. its all my fault.i dont know where this is going. i have been trying to get professional help for 8 years. i have gone to a handful of hospitals in my city. i was diagnosed with depression']\n",

      "['my boyfriend of 1,5 years and i broke up. i think the faulty one was me because i didnt like certain little things about his personality and wanted him to be perfect in my eyes, therefore treated him poorly from time to time, even if it was mild. things werent so good the last 4-5 months but we managed somehow. eventually he drew attention to it and we broke up. now, when you spend your 1,5 years with someone (we were highschool sweethearts, also he was my first boyfriend), your life sort of forms around them. breaking up feels like ripping your arm off and leaving it on the road as you try to carry on. i have so many memories with him. my life was basically him. now my problematic & obsessive personality is ruining everything in my life. i couldnt like him the way he was. i know i cant be with him now because i know nothing will change. i will remain myself, he will remain himself. i cant ask him to change and be with him, but i also cant carry on without my arm. i feel severely depressed']\n",

is it your original world view constructed and reinforced through countless years of conditioning causing this? like my mother, i too identified as the victim until i found the state of consciousness aware of my thoughts, and by being aware of them i was able to dis-associate from them similar to awakening from a dream that had taken place over my entire life.i see a lot of posts desiring to be understood by other people, for a social connection to their deeper layer of unhappiness. to this i say sure, i understand this desire. but are you simultaneously capable of understanding others not in your realm of thinking?

      "['my life ive started hating myself more and more. it started out slow with just finding some of my insecurities annoying but its evolved into hating the entirety of the person ive become and im not sure i can do anything about it. im antisocial and socially awkward but ive managed to get myself into a few different friends groups, even though im fairly certain im at the bottom of all of them. i have contradicting feelings that make me question whether im depressed or just a pussy when it comes to life. im really insecure about myself and how i act and whether what indo is perceived as normal or weird. i also almost always second guess conversations and relive every mess up i have when i flounder in casual conversation, which happens a lot. i have some really good times with these friend groups but the moment theyre over i have my lowest lows where i just lay on my bed listening to music that just makes me feel worse for hours. it feels as if im simply a spectator to life, where even though i have friend groups im often not invited or told about some events, or im talked over, or it just feels as if its unnecessary for me to be there. i think about death and wanting to die on a daily basis, yet actively committing suicide or doing anything that would purposefully put me in danger is too active. instead i constantly think \"hey itd be awesome if i could be diagnosed with some rapid fatal disease\" or \"god i really hope a truck comes out of nowhere and t-bones me when i go through this intersection\". im at a point where i dont think ill ever commit suicide, but i also dont fear death and find myself longing for it. i think there are people who care about me, mostly family and relatives but i can tell that im often a burden to them or frustrate them because im total assholes to them. i no longer am expressive towards people and often do the bare minimum to the point where i rarely even say \"i love you\" to my family members and only do it when i think im supposed to and not because i want to say it. i was doing research and im not too sure if i have schizoid because ive become pretty emotionally distant; most of the time i interact with people or friends it feels like im either faking it or altering my personality to mimick theirs because i just dont feel things the same way anymore. i think a large part of the way im feeling is because i dont have anyone in my life that cares for me or i care for. im almost 19 years old and talking to people i dont know stresses me out, ive never had a girlfriend or any super close friends, ive kept most of my personality, feelings and thoughts buried deep inside me for years. the other night when i was hanging out with my closest friend group we were all drinking and having a really good time for the first few ours. i probably drank too much and i got really depressed, and while i know alcohol can do that to you i dont think that was it; instead it simply felt like the years of covering up and burying my feelings was undone and i got a glimpse of my extremely depressed inner self, to the point where for the remainder of the night i was just sitting kneeled up in corners hating and isolating myself. my friends saw this and tried go bring me back in the conversations but i ended up just pushing them away. my one friend even came up to me and was like \"hey lets talk, anything you want to say say it and lets talk about it\" to which i basically said \"i really wish i could but i physically cant. i really appreciate you coming to try and talk, but you should just go back and enjoy yourself, im fine\". this was just the other night and i regret it so much because we all wont see each other for a few more months with winter break coming to an end and i spent the majority of our last night in a corner depressed by myself pushing them away. that night i saw how raw and depressed i am on the inside and it honestly has scared the shit out of because i didnt think i was anywhere near that low.all in all ive just become a total asshole over the years, to friends, family, people in general and i hate who ive become. and as i said before, i dont see me killing myself but i also dont see a future past college. i have no dreams or aspirations because i know ill never get there, and it feels like im only living and doing things because im supposed to and its what people expect of me. i just wish i could pop out of existence. i realize i should probably get a therapist or find someone to talk to but ive got my feelings so locked up i just cant bring myself to do it. i also fear that if i go to a therapist or doctor theyll just tell me theres nothing wrong with me and thats its all in my head or that what im experiencing isnt what i think. i feel so empty, stressed, depressed']\n",

i found a girl at my work that was worthwhile, someone i could literally see myself with. have you heard the saying, if your patient the right girl will come to you...well, she was the one for me, the girl ive waited and looked for so long. she literally had every quality i wanted from a girl, sincerely nice, outgoing and fun. i changed so much for her. i got back into shape, i started dressing really nice, i became so much more confident, funny and witty around people and i went back to finish college and even got my first real career job as a software developer just to prove to her im not a loser. in someways, it helped made me become the cool, confident person i always wanted to be and envisioned myself to be when i became 21. basically, i felt like i was at my prime and i thought that everything was going into place, this was the fantasy moment i always envisioned.she took notice of my change from that quiet shy guy to the new person i am now, and me and her got close for the past few months. we never kissed or held hands but i definitely felt some small spark and unlike other guys shes been with, she didnt mind the occasional kiss on the cheeks here and there. she is touched with the things i do for her and we would spend hours together after work. i would help her with work off the clock, comfort her when she was down and do just anything to make her happy.... she would drag me everywhere and she says my name in a certain way that just makes my heart melt. she was the first girl i ever felt being fully comfortable being just myself around. i thought this was a sign.... i just needed that one break, that one chance to prove to her that i am an awesome person that wont hurt her like her ex did to her.....i never got a real chance, i was shot down even before i could ask her out on a date...a real date with just me and her and not a group thing with her friends....she told me she did have some feelings for me, but she said shes afraid it would never workout. she said she doesnt want to lose me if it never works out....she was sincere about that but i knew the other big real reason. she is still hung up on her ex. she always told me she was over him but when a girl says shes 99% over with her ex, you know she is totally not. the ex works right next door and would always come over to her and try to patch things up with her. she never gave me a real chance because she still loves him....and im left in the dust, heartbroken, a \"friend\" in her eyes and at best a plan \"b\".....i dont talk to her as much anymore as i just wanted my feelings to die at this point....talking to her would just bring those feelings back...and i dont want to go back....the pain was already too much the first time...i became so fucking depressed. this wasnt the first time this happened to me, ive had girls do this to me before, but i didnt take it too seriously cause i wasnt really very close to those girls. but i felt so sure about this one....it was the closest ive ever been to a girl and the closest ive ever been to getting a girlfriend and for the first time ever, i truly felt the \"spark\" i always hear about from relationships. it hurts even more that despite my brain saying to just move on, my fucking heart keeps on trying to find any excuse to try again. i feel awkward now because sometimes the new coworkers comment on how i am. some are flattering, like they say how im pretty cute but others say i look like a fuckboy or a chad. its just a reminder of how much i changed. they judge my appearance and demeanor and thought i be the type to have a girlfriend but really i am a socially awkward loveless loser...and them saying that only makes me feel so fucking fake...of how much i changed for someone that never truly had the same feelings back...one things for sure, i dont think i can open up to another girl anymore....atleast for a while....now its just wallowing in my sorrow of being so alone in this fucking world....i just want one fucking chance....why is it so fucking hard to give a guy a chance....&#x200b;tl:dr;  i never had a girlfriend. every rejection pushed me to better myself in someway. recently met the girl of my dream. i got back into shape, i started dressing really nice, i became so much more confident, funny and witty around people. she was interested in me and i was in love with her, but she wouldnt let go of her ex. then she rejected me and said she liked me as a \"friend\".....biggest heartbreak ever. now, im depressed']\n",

      "['my life, ive only succeeded in having another girl just reject my feelings towards her. this makes me feel like trash because this wasnt the first time it happened. ever since middle school, every girl that rejected me had always something about me that they didnt like and me being so insecure about myself thought that perhaps if i change myself into a better person, maybe i could get someone to finally accept my feelings back.i changed so much for these girls. i changed how i looked, how i dressed, how i acted, became more fit, confident, humorous, good-looking, heck i fucking even got better grades in my school and continued my education in college just to show off i am not a loser....as if i am like competing for being an eligible bachelor in those cheesy sitcoms. nobody wouldve recognized the disgusting, nervous wreck of a person i was before into the confident guy i am now.&#x200b;heres a picture of me on the left with the stripe shirt:[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/d/d0/1252512511.png/revision/latest?cb=20181001021806](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/d/d0/1252512511.png/revision/latest?cb=20181001021806)&#x200b;yet even when i changed so much, even when i felt like i was at my prime and at the tender age of 21, i still fucking failed! this latest girl was soooo different from all the other girls ive met. i truly felt like she was going to be the one, the girl that would be my very first love. but i was an idiot. i guess the last flaw i never was able to get fixed was figuring out if a girl liked me or not. i waited too long and didnt show my affection and now her feelings towards me had vanished. i realized my mistake the moment she said these words...\"just be yourself ramon, you dont have to be anyone else to impress me\"......no girl has ever said such a thing to me, and when i heard it from her, thats when i instantly fell in love wit her. i realized my mistake and tired desperately to rekindle that feeling but i couldnt get her to have the same spark she had before. she said in her own say that she has still embers of feeling towards me, but that she didnt believe it would last long if me and her got together. from what conversations we had for each other, it seemed to me shed rather keep me as a friend then to lose me as a person.....she was a truly amazing person, and despite myself, i was more than willing now more than ever to be anything she wanted me to be if she just gave me one last chance. but apparently this girl doesnt have feelings for people based on how they are as a person but more if she holds a certain spark for them. my spark for her is immense and white-hot but her for me is small embers.i hope you guys understand my feelings right now as i typed this with tears rolling down my cheeks as i had to vent my feelings out somewhere. ive heard soon she will be leaving the workplace me and her both work at (which is the only place me and her really get to be together) and i feel like i will never find another girl like her in the world. she always says that even if we wont see each other for a while, she still thinks we are close friends but despite myself i cant see myself without her. she isnt allowed to go out and have social interactions because of her strict parents, so i keep on being afraid she would find someone else in her new job and she would forever be taken from me. shes going to be another reminder of my failure in finding love and i am once again alone. the reason why i desperately seek love is because ive never felt any true love in my own family and i cant get the same feeling from my friends. she was a truly loving person and her family was very loving as well, the kind of family i always wanted growing up and i was more than willing to be a part of. i was willing to have given her the world...now here i am....back at my community college working to transfer to san diego state university, working a second job as programming intern job in a medical/health tech startup. sometimes i contemplate if i should go work at the new place where she is planning to work next just so i can get some quality time with her again. some people would say that i am successful and happy and getting somewhere in life. what they dont know is that deep inside, i am insecure, alone and depressed']\n",

      "['my parents early divorce, probable attachment disorder and intermittent emotional neglect and psychological abuse.  i was diagnosed at 16 and had some good luck with anti-depression meds at first.  my mainstay coping mechanisms, though, developed in early college:  alcohol and weed.  i did take meds intermittently, but never felt great about big pharmas game and the results were so mixed that although i was often using anti-depressants and stimulants, i mostly tried to self medicate, plus drinking and getting high were socially acceptable and encouraged in my friend groups.  i also fell in love in early adulthood, and 18 years later i’m divorced with a (now 10 year old) son.  and although we had a good 12 years, the final years of marriage were awful.  the sobriety of parenting together undid us, and i firmly believe it was in no small part because we no longer were able to numb out on booze together.  plus i was not able to get it up (thanks years of weed and meds!) which of course did not help the reduction of intimacy that often follows a first child.  years of resentment boiled up as we proved to be more and more out of love as our beautiful baby became a boy.  my ex dealt with our dysfunction by sleeping with my trusted “friend”. the ugly end of literally the only beneficial family relationship i had left, that seemed unshakable only years before, also happened at about the same time as my career collapse, something that also seemed unlikely.  in that same year my marriage shattered, i had to walk out of the elementary classroom i taught to be tried before hr for the decline of my abilities, only to lose my composure so entirely that i had to go home mid-day without even saying good-bye to the students.  i went on long term disability the next day for my mental state and never returned to that school or classroom teaching.   my son’s age at the unraveling of our relationship, being almost identical to my own when my folks split, caused any healing i had done from that trauma to explode and fester.  i was going through all this as we marched through the stages of pre-trial divorce.  at the time i was given more and more meds to help me through, and i kicked regular substance use entirely, dropping decades worth of friendships (built on substances) from my life.  now it is almost 6 years later and i have had some successes (reduced my meds, still living without substances, steady employment) but have very little to show for a life at my age.  yes i am a consistent and loving dad (i know that is not a small thing, and i’m proud of that) with 50% custody but my income is just barely enough to allow me to live in the gentrified neighborhood my son knows and loves, that is near his mom, his school and his friends.  i have a career i can handle without having to be on tons of meds (nannying for a wealthy family) but i do not have any growth opportunities there, no prestige, no long term plan, no benefits, no retirement.  i am living paycheck to paycheck.  and even though i did have a positive relationship after the divorce for a couple of years, i am alone now and after a year of online dating and some near misses, i feel like from the outside i am a man without a future, without money, without an extended family and without ambition (beyond not being depressed).  although i look pretty good, i have persistent foot pain and low energy. i feel like i stink of mid-life collapse and i am losing faith that i will ever be able to attract anyone who can help me be the person i am capable of being, someone that i can love and be loved by.so back to my question:  since my sobriety and recent reduction of medications (this past year), i have become much less numb to my pain and tragic history. i am feeling all the feelings. as i have made my life smaller and more manageable i have tried to confront the feelings that drive so much of my inner conflict.  i have delved into many books, self-guided classes and attempts at living a more healthy life.  i have gone deeper into psychotherapy than i ever could have on all those meds, but i am so deflated and tired  from the depth of the lows, that i wonder if really feeling my feelings is going to help me anymore.  i have been able to find a few core things that i can tell really do help me (yoga, exercise, journaling, low-inflammation dieting, meditation) but i cannot seem to make any of them actual habits.  it’s hard to take on new habits alone, with almost no community and little discretionary income to invest in myself.from reading and listening to lots of books (on attachment, psychology, self-help, mindfulness, etc) i have been left with the overriding feeling that addressing my problems starts with developing good habits.  that if i only improve my character by developing better mental toughness then i will no longer live my traumas over and over again, and i’ll be able to use self-discipline to move on and contextualize my past so i can thrive in the present and future.  my therapist sees encouraging signs in our sessions, but my psychiatrist is very concerned at my plunging scores on depression']\n",

      "['myself to be happy, i was getting good grades, and on the surface i seemed like i was successful. i didn’t get into the university of my choice, but i was offered an opportunity to reapply if my gpa was high enough. at my graduation there was this girl i had started talking to from one of my classes. she was a 10/10, but a lot of people i knew didn’t like her because of what one of her ex’s says about her (that she’s crazy and a whore). i offered her some help early that year dealing with some of his crap and we became friends over it. everyone was hugging so i felt no shame in hugging her too. about a month later i broke up with my girlfriend. it took me 3 years to realize the whole time i was being emotionally abused and drained to the point my family noticed a complete change in my happiness. i went to drink the pain away, and instead of drinking alone like an idiot, i wanted to drink with someone that understood the pain i was going through. i texted her and she said yes, but she would have to sneak out. enter one of the best nights of my life and the start to the most memorable summer ever. we started dating two or three weeks later, after i was one of the few people to ask what happened to her when her phone went dark (she had gotten in serious trouble from her parents, no cell), and immediately fell in love with her family and her. she broke me out of a shell i had no idea i was in. we were sporadic, doing things on a whim. i had always wanted to live my life on a “why not” basis, and that was the only way we did anything. we would only plan for bigger things, occasionally throwing them out for better ones. in the summer she allowed me to experience what it meant to have fun, and to enjoy life. fall hit her hard though. she has so many problems from her dad leaving her family, one of which is seasonal depression. when i went off to college, we tried to make it work. she started to exist on seeing me on that once a week schedule, me being the only one to make her feel happier and fulfilled. meanwhile i had so much trouble adjusting and taking the pressure. i cut for the first time just before i left, and cut again later in the semester. i was disgusted with myself, but for some reason i still did it again. one night i nearly put a knife through my forearm, and another with my girlfriend, had a panic attack while drunk. she forced me to seek a therapist, and without that i likely would have been making this post. i cried on the way back home with her, and she was right there for me, realizing how fucked up i was. to say that it was all perfect though would be an oversight. we did break up during the semester and she did see someone for a one time thing. i decided not to hold it against her because of what she meant to me, and because it was totally stupid on her part. we would bicker at times too, often times because i would say something stupid because of a lack of social skills and her belief that she was fragile. yet it still worked until about middle of the semester where she greened out at a party and woke up to a guy who made a move on her. that was some final straw for her, and i think it broke her on some level and we broke up for the second time. assuming she needed time to figure things out, i started talking to close friends about the incident to get their opinions. i spoke to one of them who i forgot was a mandatory reporter. for the sake of brevity, i had to make a police report, and the night i made it she got a phone call from the local police department and the next day three officers showed up in her school. she screamed at me, but i knew what was at stake and what i had just done. her family lived on a knifes edge, and she was trying to repair her relationship with her mom. her friends could have started asking questions, possibly leaving her. her freedom became questionable, as she was getting high again, which was the reason in the summer she had got in so much trouble. but nothing happened. and i had to fix this. i hadn’t played piano in 10 years, yet two days after she screamed at me, i began again. in 10 days, i learned the song that symbolized the entire thing to me. i originally gave myself a window of 14 days, but i was ready. i recorded it and sent it to her, with the best apology i could have come up with. “it’s beautiful, but it doesn’t change anything.”and i knew that. but again in vain i still tried, i promised myself i would be home for her birthday so i was. i had already started on her gift and gave it to her. i just wanted to have a true conversation with her about all of this. to get closure and to understand what the future would hold. i have her my gift and asked her to talk to me, so we did. we talked for two hours. it came down to us being fundamentally different people, but agreeing we were each other’s best. that we could not be friends because the feelings would be to great. that we should try to move on from each other, and maybe decades down the line reconnect. when we hugged as a final goodbye, my throat hitched. she pulled away and put her hand on my face. she realized what she did immediately, but that was the moment that i became me. that i started to close off again.it was like this until she wished me happy birthday. she was the only one to do so, because i tell no one about it. but even my best friends didn’t say a word, so it meant something to me. i’m hindsight it was rather innocuous, but i dwelled on it for a little while. then walking through the city with my family it happened for the first time. i was looking at christmas lights and i saw us. laughing, looking up at the lights, holding each other. i blinked and it was gone. those moments have been happening occasionally since, in places that meant something to me or to us. i will see us in the perfect instagram ready photo, and it will ruin me for the day. i’ve tried my best to move on, got a tinder, started talking to as many people as possible. nothing works, and i realized it’s because i’ve been given the gift of caring for others: not flirting. so i’m going to delete my tinder and make sure that i’m not so stupid moving forward. about a week ago, i noticed her instagram post were getting progressively more depressing. she blocked me and unblocked in a span of 12 hours. i decided to say something, not as someone wanting her back, but as someone who was genuinely concerned. she said she was fine, and we texted until i got a one word response. now to summarize: we have the girl who broke me out of my shell and helped me experience life. who probably stopped me from someday killing myself. who was the one who taught me what true love really meant. and that i ruined in one action, to destroy any future chance i had. what i want now is what i wanted two months ago. i want this fixed, and i want to be able to hold her again. i decided this january i would think about making another attempt to reconnect, but if it seems too much i won’t. i really think it’s done and over with. i don’t need to hear the crap about “there’s so many other fish in the sea.” i know there are. but how many fish do you believe you owe your life to? that you think about every night? that you sometimes cry yourself to sleep over?if i had the chance again, i would live my life to the fullest with her. i’d change my dreams based on this one delusion. and i’m not sure if the world would agree with me. i just needed to put this in writing. if you’re still with me, am i crazy? i already know i’m depressed']\n",

treatment for depression in particular. im 22 now but ive been dealing with body image issues since i was 11 and the bulimia from sophomore year of high school. that was around the same time i started self harming. but no one could tell-i made sure to hurt myself in places covered by clothes and i still kept the same cheery demeanor i did everyday. i had good grades, a small but stable group of friends,  sports, played in the marching band. never went to a party. the ideal, boring high school student. my family had some issues, mainly between my brother and my dad, but i tried to stay out of it and be the dutiful daughter. doing chores, watching my siblings, listening to my parents. the self harming curbed as i was about to go to college but my eating disorder got worse. got to college and my first 2 years were pretty rough academically. skated by on natural talent in high school and realized that doesnt fly in university. ignored my grades and just tried to socialize as much as possible and started restricting my diet like crazy and working out for at least 2 hours a day just to feel in control. dropped to 105lb (im 54). was diagnosed with adhd my junior year much to the dismay of my parents-i was supposed to be the golden child. my brother was the trouble kid with the depression, anger issues, and adhd. just got medicated never went to therapy. junior year i was in a relationship. felt like i was soaring, continued to do mediocre in my classes and when i began to crash, i tried to turn to my then boyfriend for support but turns out he would rather go out to the bar and talk to other people. we broke up at the end of the year. depended on him so much i lost touch with a lot of friends and opportunities. during that time i didnt take my adhd meds regularly. just made me feel like shit that i had to take them in the first place. senior year my stress, depression, and anxiety was even worse. felt suicidal. was vomiting everyday and my grades were plummeting. felt like i was an idiot for picking a major as difficult as computer science when i wasnt applying myself like i should. tried a couple therapy sessions at the end of the year and tried to talk to my mom about sitting in on a session over the phone and she screamed at me about how i was faking/overreacting. dropped to 94lb around this time. i was also about to take my 5th year cause i had planned my classes so horribly and also wanted to improve my gpa. i think i wouldve really hurt myself seriously if my current boyfriend wasnt there to just keep me company and be positive. still, i never told him fully what was going on. now hes in california and im on the east coast and were doing a long distance thing and hes still amazing. so loving and kind and ive let him know to a small extent my feelings of depression and i made it seem like i used to have an eating disorder though i still have episodes to this day. but things at home are getting worse and my mom and dad are fighting, my brother (20, has pretty mentally abusive tendencies stemming from anger and depression) is making things harder on my mom and i can see her starting to crack. my little sister (11) cries in secret after their fights and im the one who tries to comfort her when shes trying to get away. im at home now for winter break and im so stressed about home life once i leave and my mom has no one to help her cook, clean, or listen to her. also been stressed this past month because last semester, right before finals i fainted twice in 3 days and got concussed. felt silly the first time i fainted (during an exam) and tried to brush it off and just made a couple appointments to check myself out the next week. fainted 2 days later, hit my head harder. concussed. still have headaches and my mood has been even lower but i still have to study. yet, im still trying to be supportive and happy for my mom. trying to help around the house while studying for the exams i couldnt take. trying to build a better relationship with my brother and help him even when he hurls abuse at me, not that thats always. trying and trying but not feeling like im making any progress. feel like im a failure. ive always \"joked\" for the last few years i wasnt gonna make it past 30 cause of stress and the fact i get sick all the time. been saying that a little more often and my boyfriends picking up on it and hes starting to get concerned but now im doing my best to cover it up. last night, he called me and i joked i wanted to die. but for a bit i didnt know if i was joking. i wasnt even sad anymore. just reached a point where i didnt feel anything and just thought of how i could kill myself-obviously didnt act on it. just told my boyfriend i didnt much want to talk about what was going on and went to sleep. i dont know if this is dissociation but i can imagine myself being gone without feeling much right now. and at the moment that doesnt even scare me. just wanted to get that off my chest. &#x200b;tldr; i look happy, successful, healthy, and smart but im dealing with an eating disorder, family issues, post concussion syndrome, academic struggles, and what i think is

arranged marriage or tinder. so lets talk about an arranged marriage. i have to tell my family background to the family of the girl before i get to see her. and i live in seattle. it should be safe for me to not disclose these details and still be a nice person. because my family is composed of simple village-dwelling people. my parents are the sweetest people in the world but they are not successful, they dont have any accolades to show off. they still say that me and my brother are their biggest achievements, i mean the kind of people we have grown up as. they wont qualify any screening test and so wont i. now lets talk about tinder or neo-dating. im brown, im fit but im not athletic. im decent looking but im no rockstar. i write nice messages to everyone on okcupid. i do feel frustrated at times but i still am not rude to anybody for their choice of not liking me. i get it. but where does that put me? three years. not a single good friend. and its getting worse. i have lost my energy to want to impress people. and neither do i expect this from someone. i know im not a 10. i usually dont message anybody out of my league. the only people i dont message are people who i am not attracted to at all. and i guess the people who reject me are coming from a similar position. but it essentially creates capitalism out of dating. i dont want sex. i dont want anything hot. or a person who hikes. i just someone who likes me. and i would genuinely try to make it work. i wont reject someone because they dont have a wanderlust or if they are a recovering alcoholic. do other people see dating in this way? in my experience, a lot of us dont.i meditated. i wrote my journals. i read amazing books. i watched amazing shows and movies. i learnt to make music. i learnt to appreciate all kinds of music. i became well versed in philosophy. i am on my journey to become fairly well versed in psychology. i got healthy and i ran for miles. people say that im intelligent and creative. but at the same time, i got a pornhub premium subscription. i have smoked weed almost everyday for the past two years. my career makes no sense. i developed a bit of an eating disorder. i broke up with my best friend and my girlfriend. i want to go back to india but where exactly? thats a shitty feeling you know. the home no longer exists. when people tell me that im intelligent and creative, i think they are just saying it. they dont mean it. i see that the problem here is with self-esteem. i see all my problems very clearly. i still cant fix them. my hands go automatically to weed, then to my penis and then to pornhub. i constantly lie to myself and also to others. thats the depressing']\n",

      "['my life is telling me that im \"too young to be depressed\" or that i \"have a good life, i dont have a reason to be depressed\", so ive started to assume that theyre right. they cant all be wrong, can they?i have been feeling the way that i do since i was 7-8 years old. i remember lying in bed and begging the gods for death when i was that age.currently i am 15 years old, and im at the lowest point in my life. it has been getting especially bad for the last three years or so. i feel like im missing out on life and stress myself about that, but at the same time, the sheer thought doing anything is strenuous. i constantlly feel hopeless and empty; things that used to be my favourite things in the world now seem meaningless and too hard to do. ive never had a girlfriend, and i have yet to experience my first kiss. i feel ugly and worthless and unloved. im starving for physical and mental attention, but at the same time i feel the need to isolate myself from the rest of humanity. my social battery is totally drained after only a few hours of being out of my room. the next problems are my sleeping and eating habits. i sleep way too much. during the peak times of this habit i used to sleep for up to 18 hours per day, a bit less on school days. i go to sleep at 7pm, wake up at 2pm and feel more exhausted than when i wake up. even when i get a healthy amount of sleep, i still feel this way, but i havent slept through for a long time anyway. i need several hours to fall asleep.i think this habit developed because sleep is a great way to escape reality, and because i constantly feel exhausted. i feel exhausted if i do _nothing_ at all. i can sit in bed and do nothing all day but i still feel like is just ran a marathon. my eating habits are also out of control. i eat way too much; i binge eat unhealthy shit to the point where i almost vomit. this has also caused me to gain weight, as you can imagine.someone please help me. i want to die, but ive been told that it is selfish and unfair. i wish i knew if those things that i feel are actual depression']\n",

(i wish i could see a doctor or therapist, as well; however, my parents blow over every request i make to see one, since either a.) its a waste of money or b.) mental illness is all in your head).going back to my brother, he had an hour long conversation about my attitude and my depression']\n",

      "['my first large entry on reddit. it is really hard to summarize everything that happens in my messed up head, but i can try.i don’t have many memories until i was 8, except for the fact that i was a fully happy child, always kinda quiet and reclusive, but plenty happy. i had a lot of friends and family attention, i had lots of dreams, but everything started to turn in december 1, 2001. five days before my 8 year old birthday, my dad dies. it was a really rare disease, i can’t even name it (and for some reason i really never wanted to know exactly what it was). but all i remember was seeing my old man, who was a physical educator, getting weaker and weaker. as a child who have never had contact to death, i wasn’t understanding it very well. all i knew was that he was going to be ok. that didn’t happened. he was my role model. but who could tell that 2002 was one of the best years of my life? i felt so warmed by all of my family that moment. it was a rough time for everybody, but we united. i remember every night sleeping in the same room with my mom and my little brother. i felt protected. our grandparents really helped us financially (and still do, as they paid mine and my brother’s college). but, in 2003, my mom met my stepfather, and, from there, things just became worse and worse.  i had no problems with him for the next 2 years. i kinda liked him. he was not my father, but i liked him. we used to play soccer games together in the ps2. but after some time his attitude changed. he became more… explosive?i was becoming a teenager and i always had something of a dark humor (not the racist/mysoginist/homophobic shit, but still dark humor). one day, he almost broke up with my mom after i made a joke calling him poor (he always had this strange money obsession, he really thinks he is rich, but we are just middle class). as a kid i was really confused with all of that, but that escalated. one day, going to the beach for the weekend, i got spanked in the car by my mom as my stepfather cheered it while driving. the motive was another joke that i made, about my stepfather shitting his pants (yeah he used to do that and leave the shitty underwear behind the bathroom door). that day was too much, too much for me and still terrifies me when i remember. i had never got beaten until that day. my cousin and my brother were in the car too. nobody did nothing to stop that.from that day on, my relationship with my mom went in a downward spiral of beating and shouting. for anything. the result? bad grades, isolation, tries with tobacco, alcohol and marijuana (at 13, 14 and 15yo respectivelly)... the whole family structure tumbled down. even today, i can’t communicate properly with my mom since i evolved a serious blockage. i don’t speak to my stepfather for more than 10 years, even living under the same roof. and it fucking messes with me.but, besides the experimentations with drugs and stuff, my teenage years were kinda normal. out of my house, i was a pretty confident person. i still had many friends (maybe not the best guys, but still friends), i had 3 girlfriends between 2008 and 2011, doing good enough to enter the journalism university… life was going on but, still, something was growing inside of me.my university didn’t helped a lot. i didn’t made any friends. it was not a campus, but just a cold, grey, boring building just downtown (still, academically, one of the best journalism colleges here in brazil). but after that, i got a freelance job at one of the biggest newspapers here in my state, so i thought the objective was accomplished.but i couldn’t avoid the troubles in my house, that kept going. so, in my time with my friends, i was really into drugs and alcohol and i spent several years in this. i feel like it was a time bomb, and, one day… boom. my first panic attack. it was a time that i was into cocaine and using it pretty much, every week. after that, i haven’t touched any synthetic drugs, even though i’m still pretty addicted to marijuana. one month after, i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. things were never the same.i got treatment, i got therapy, i had medicine, i tried to exercise, i tried to stop smoking pot and cigarettes. i tried pretty much what people tell us to do, but i failed in everything. from then on, every shit that happened to me seemed to hurt like 10x more. i broke up with a lot of people since then. even with all of this, i always tried to help my friends, all of them have similar problems, one of them even told me i saved his live with support during a anxiety attack. but i feel like nobody give a fuck about me. nobody ask how am i doing. nothing. not even a message.i got dispensed from my job after disagreements with my toxic disgusting fucking boss. and, last year, i decided to take my money and make my first travel outside the country, just by myself. surprisingly, in the middle of the darkness, i had the most legitimate moment of happiness i ever had. i spent 1 month around the coast of california. the 3 weeks i had in san diego were just magical. i met so many wonderful people and felt so welcomed. but, as it ended and i found myself in my mediocre life again, my happiness ended also.it has been rough, rough times. in the last 19 months i lost everything. at least, the little i still had. i broke up with basically all of my friends. i lost confidence. i feel like i can’t get outside my bedroom without being anxious. i’m terrified by panic attacks. i started to fear life and the outside world. i lost all interest in hobbies i once had. i lost my family because, in my head, my stepfather stole it from me. i lost the job i still had because of depression']\n",

      "['myself as a journal entry. i know its long as hell.]im not feeling particularly low right now but im not feeling good or content either. if emotions are a wave then right now im in neither a crest nor a trough. my line looks pretty horizontal actually and i dont really know which direction will come next.there seem to be alot of posts recently about people wanting to find their passion. i totally understand this desire. however, it seems like they believe that it would make life easy to have one. (same thing with relationships but thats another story altogether...) my experience has been the opposite.i always knew what i wanted to do with my life. since i was about 10 or 11. its difficult to have discovered your passion so young (or at all, i believe). its funny how certainty can breed frustration in that way. everything else has changed entirely - even my very body and mind - except for that one thing.it can be comforting at times, for sure. sometimes when im surrounded by turmoil it can be nice to listen to the songs i loved when i was young. its effectively just like stepping in a time machine and travelling back there but without having to deal with all the painful parts of the past.im grateful for that indeed, but as i said, its hard having a constant thread in life. its exhausting and very often disappointing. being passionate about something (or some*one* for that matter) makes you really vulnerable to being hurt. im not just referring to criticism, be it internal or external... its like being naked and exposed in a way. its as if you have no way of covering up or protecting yourself because that would be to erase the fact that you are passionate. its kinda like the end of the trial - pink floyd. having a passion or enthusiasm for something is like the judge and the crowd yelling \"tear down the wall! tear down the wall!\" but all of it being completely silent and only inside your own head.now obviously this will sound like a complete exaggeration to most. im aware of that. i dont know if this is something unique to the modern world or if it always existed, but i feel like people who care alot about one thing are alienated. youre supposed to be well balanced in your interests and if not then youre just \"weird\". nobody likes to hear about one thing for any length of time or think about it deeply. after a certain point its \"enough now\" and onwards to the next thing. and i just get the impression that everyone is always skipping the track right before the really good part starts!but anyway, it doesnt really matter what others think or say. most passionate people are their own worst critics. even if you were in a room full of people praising you, it would still be possible to feel like a failure. fulfillment can only ever come from within and its a bloody difficult thing to achieve.i know that the only way to do that is to accept what you have and what you are. gratitude is also helpful, not just for the blessing but for the obstacles too. but why is it so hard to be supportive of and encouraging to myself? it comes so easily towards others, what makes me different?i know that thats a pretty standard experience in depressed people. i have made alot of progress in encouraging myself in other areas of life. however when it comes to my main interest i still struggle to feel adequate and worthy.i think one of the main reasons is that most people often put their younger selves down and dismiss who they used to be. theyre too afraid to empathise with their past selves. instead they call them naïve, immature or just plain stupid. but i dont do that. not anymore at least. i can laugh at my younger self, definitely! but i never belittle, insult or demean my past selves. theyre still a part of me after all. back then i did the best i could with what i knew at the time and i have to respect that.i feel really good when i notice something that would make my younger self feel proud. each time that i accomplish something that i only ever dreamed of doing before, it just fills my heart right up. :) thats why i trust the instincts i had as a kid. after all i did, amongst some other things, have fantastic taste in music for a 13 year old.if that little girl could meet me as i am now, i reckon shed think im pretty cool. that means alot to me. all the thoughts and feelings in my head right now would make no sense to her whatsoever. shed definitely love my tattoo as well. i definitely feel a sense of responsibility to make her proud because i had a really difficult, really shitty childhood. my depression']\n",

      "['my fair share of fun in relationships. i was confident, passionate, creative, enjoyed networking and had a great career ahead. but now - career going nowhere, not even close to fulfilling my potential and losing interest in work (which means constant stress and anxiety). also lacking the confidence to make any changes, mainly because i have pretty much lost my life outside of work - no friends left, lost my social skills, and the youthful bravado, fire and passion i had before. how do i go about rediscovering my old self? how do i find some sort of joy and hope to get better in life? at least can someone relate and share their experiences? **here’s what happened:** i had a series of bad jobs with toxic work environments in the last few years. this meant extra hours in the evenings and weekends cleaning up after others’ mistakes, and even when i was free i would be mentally and emotionally drained to face my friends. i began to isolate myself and slowly my support group thinned and disappeared (i myself even pushed some away due to growing shame). i was also repeatedly passed over for recognition and promotion despite giving *so, so much* to work (to be honest, much more than what my colleagues did) and i got absolutely nothing in return. which means that today i am far short of my potential. i’m stuck in yet another job around people who don’t know much about anything (nor do they care) while my ex-colleagues have progressed in their careers to high-paying jobs and influential, valuable networks. this unfairness frustrates and demoralises me and makes me question why i’m even bothering in life. what got me through the tough times in the previous jobs was spending time with my old friends and support groups, and my interests outside of work. i kept reminding myself that it was \"just a job\", and the real joy was in doing my own things i was passionate about like startups, tech, gadgets, photography, games, and music. but i’ve got no friends or support groups anymore, i’ve even become a stranger in the interest groups i used to be part of. it kills me to realise that while my interests got sucked out by work, others who may have been less gifted have kept at it and made a name for themselves as influential in these circles. my physical fitness also has nosedived, with bad habits like smoking, alcohol, junk food, junk online content and porn. my appearance is shabby — i even skip shower and shaving some days. i’ve tried to go out and make new friends from scratch but as it is this is difficult at my age. and with my sense of humour and social skills becoming almost non-existent after going through the last few years’ experiences, im finding it near impossible to be jovial or even smile. i’ve tried online dating sites and tinder for relationships but have found no luck (i’m average looking). heck i can’t even look at a girl now due to the shame i feel when i think how less experienced and fun i might be than guys 10 years younger than me. and no, it doesn’t help to say sign up for an activity that i like doing because like i said, i’ve lost interest in most things. i can’t even seem to relax and find a few minutes to take my mind off work and watch a tv show or something without feeling stressed and anxious about my future.  i’ve thought of  changing jobs again and even saw some really good positions i would be great for, but can’t muster up the confidence to go through the job search. and besides, what if the next one is even worse? i even thought of doing my own thing outside work and network around to freelance or start something up on my own. i’m good at convincing people and selling myself when i’m inspired and when i have belief in my capabilities but my low self-esteem and self-doubt is proving to be a mental block.how do i get out of thus rut and back on my feet? how do i improve myself at work, and at the same time find hope and joy in other things before i spiral into a hole i can’t get out of? how do find joy and live happily and free of fear, anxiety and depression']\n",

      "['my parents home after doing a 4-year stint in another city (which i did after getting out of a mental hospital, thinking that by moving away i could \"start fresh\").  i was so depressed that i could barely talk.i had just gotten back from a friends wedding in another city, where i basically drank wine like it was water and passed out drunk next to a port-a-potty, fairly early in the night.  i was sure that i was going to kill myself soon.  absolutely, positively certain.i remember my mom driving me somewhere, and she just broke down crying, saying that i needed to get a job.  i couldnt even say anything to that.  here i was, 28 years old, unemployed, living at my parents with a broken brain that wouldnt stop telling me how much i suck and how ill never get better.id tried like every antidepressant out there.  i felt like my depression was stronger than any antidepressant.  like those were for normal people who get sad.  i felt almost too smart for antidepressants, like the way that they actually work is all placebo effect and i dont fall for that kind of thing.this was like my 8th major depressive episode, by the way.  id already been hospitalized 4 times by this point.  and one of those times, the hospitalization actually made me feel better, and i came out full of confidence, which resulted in me moving away from my hometown, which resulted, eventually, in everything falling apart in a city where i barely knew anyone.  i remember crying on my way home from work for almost an entire winter.anyway, i was drifting.  i had nothing to do and i was terrified of every social interaction.  i forget who found it, me or my parents, but i read that nih in the dc area was doing a study on ketamine as an antidepressant.  id done ketamine before, and i actually remembered that it made me feel euphoric for a couple of months (after a weekends worth of use).  i called, and was accepted.so i moved up to bethesda, md.  i was in a hospital ward, but it wasnt locked or anything.  in fact, i did a lot of sightseeing, eventually.  in the beginning all i did was stay in my room and watch netflix.  i didnt even talk to anyone else.  people there thought i was standoffish, i later learned.i had to get weaned off my medications first for the ketamine trial.  that took like 6 weeks.  i didnt feel any different, helping to strengthen my suspicion that the medicines i was on didnt actually do anything.  i also got my brain scanned a few times, which involved sitting for a really long time inside an mri tube and not moving.  once i fell asleep in there.then the trial!  well, maybe.  it was an experiment where they gave you 2 infusions: one is actually ketamine, the other is placebo (saline, i think).but i got k the first time.  of course i cant say that with 100% certainty, because they never revealed which was which, but i was seeing shapes and colors and trails and was saying that i couldnt control my mouth and words were being spoken through me rather than by me.  the second time i felt nothing at all, so judge for yourself.however, even though i experienced the k, i didnt actually feel better.  i only started to feel better when they put me on zyprexa, which amazingly stopped my social anxiety.  then i started talking to other people in the trial, and making some friends.  i was still depressed but was functional.i went home around thanksgiving.  i had started running and cooking while at nih, and tried to keep that up at home.  i wasnt happy, but i was talking, and that was a start.  i was still basically a nervous wreck, but i got an interview for a coding job, did really well, and got the job (for some reason im never nervous at interviews).  i spent the first month at that job almost puking from anxiety every day, but i made some friends with the smokers, and i realized that it wasnt so bad.  plus it was easy.  plus i could move into my own place now!but i still wasnt happy.  however, one of the other people from the ketamine clinical trial apparently had wonderful results with k and started http://www.ketamineadvocacynetwork.org/ to promote its use as an antidepressant.  i found a doctor near me who administered it, and called him up.  when he heard i was in the clinical trial, he set me up with an appointment (i guess because id basically been pre-screened by the government).i got a series of 5 infusions.  each time i tripped balls.  i mean, ive done drugs, but this was about as wild as it gets.  however, it was different from other experiences, in that i felt like i could experience my mind from outside of itself.  like i could analyze it without judgement, and change it without fear.right after the first infusion, i felt a burst of energy and went running (when i got home).  the next day, everything felt lighter, easier, like it was a game.  these feelings intensified after each infusion, and i gradually thought i had a \"cheat code\" for life.this seems appropriate; its from an interview with donald glover:> glover said that he thinks of reality as a program and his talent as hacking the code: “i learn fast—i figured out the algorithm.” grasping the machine’s logic had risks. “when people become depressed and kill themselves, it’s because all they see is the algorithm, the loop,” he said. but it was also exhilarating. when he was ten, he said, “i realized, if i want to be good at p.e., i have to be good at basketball. so i went home and shot baskets in our driveway for six hours, until my mother called me in. the next day, i was good enough that you wouldn’t notice i was bad. and i realized my superpower.”anyway, that was about 4 years ago.  i now have a prescription for ketamine, which i take at maintenance levels.  ive gone through a lot of bad shit in those 4 years, but ive taught myself how to become resilient (the trick is to go through bad stuff a lot...bend but dont break).  i try to help other people by facilitating dbsa meetings and talking about my life.  i also started volunteering at habitat for humanity because physical effort is good and its good karma.my life isnt perfect.  im not dating anyone, and im worried that its a bad idea to date me because in the past ive fallen into depressions']\n",

      "['my online friend who lives a few hours away has had a hard life, depression and suicidal thoughts. shes already attempted suicide at one point in the past, although i dont know details. in her adult life shes only ever met people who have either outright rejected her when they found out she had this illness, or treated her differently because of it. in meeting her online, ive become her *only* support system for this horrible illness. she doesnt know any good irl friends, and her boyfriend, though seemingly genuinely a great guy in all other respects, has deep-seated problems with talking about mental illness. she cuts herself and although meeting me has helped her because i treat her the way she should be treated, i think she would benefit a lot from a bigger support system, and treatment for depression.the first problem with this is that shes become incredibly wary of telling people about her depression, understandably, and sees herself as nothing but a waste of space who deserves to die. shes told me that it would be extremely unfair to introduce people to her problems because she has an \"expiration date\", and that shes going to be sad for the rest of her life anyway and theres nothing she can do about it. she hopes she dies so she doesnt suffer more, and she doesnt want to make other people suffer by telling them. she has a huge discord that she runs where shes friends with all the regulars there, except they dont know. if she told them, they would completely, 100% support her, but again, see above. her boyfriend is the same problem, see above.the second problem is that she needs treatment. pills, therapy, but a) she has ocd about money, and shes poor-ish. even if she didnt think it was a waste to pay for treatment in the first place, her ocd makes it so that she has a hard time spending large amounts of money. she doesnt even look at her bank account half the time because it upsets this part of her. i have ocd myself and this isnt an easy thing to overcome. also, b), i dont know what resources she could potentially access that would be free or cheap.i will take *any* advice, help or resources. she lives in south carolina, if that helps. she and i talk pretty much all day every day except when i work, and although i genuinely love talking to her as much as we do, shes incredible in every way, i feel like the only way shes going to get better past what i can help with by being there, is if she opens up to more people, makes that connection, especially with her boyfriend, and seeks treatment. but i dont know how to do any of those things without forcing her, even though i have brought them up multiple times. these issues are too big for me alone to be able to remedy, i think, even if i can help her by being there for her in the now.please, depressed people, friends of depressed people, *anybody*, i will take any assistance or guidance. i just want to help her live the good life she deserves to live because i love her.-----------------------------------------------------------so i have an online friend who has depression and suicidal thoughts/tendencies, on top of having a hard life in the past and obsessive compulsive tendencies.im ocd myself, but even though ive never really been truly happy with my life to any degree until like this year, and ive been *depressed* for really long periods, i have scars on my arms, the whole deal, i dont believe i have clinical depress*ion*. but my reason for asking for help goes a bit deeper than that.**this will be sort of long, but bear with me please**, im sorry. i really could use some advice and resources.the situation is that i met her probably a month or more ago online through a discord. we just really started hitting it off and although i normally shy away from excessive conversation with new people i meet, ive been in a rough patch the last few months myself and i wasnt really thinking about it.the reason i try not to do that is because i have emotional dependent tendencies. ive self regulated since ive realized i had them, and they dont really show up anymore, but multiple times in my life, to varying degrees of severity, ive become emotionally dependent on someone.so we started talking more and more and since those first few days, we have literally been talking all day every day. now, obviously, this sounds fucking horrible because again, i have the history of dependency (one time it happened was literally with an online friend where we talked 100% of the time), and shes depressed.but the reason weve been doing this is because she *needs* it, from what i can gather. i learned very quickly into us talking about random stuff that she has shitty family, depression, she mentioned her boyfriend hiding sharp objects from her and i mean, hey, i self harmed before, so i offered to help if she needed someone to talk to about that, and now its a whole thing. long story short she grew up in a *horrible* family situation and was mostly isolated from anyone she could ever confide in and trust as a person. in addition to that, shes 20 and somehow every single friend shes met in her adult life has either treated her differently once theyve learned she has the thoughts she does, or left her entirely. fake friends. its *really* fucked up and i honestly dont know how that even could have happened. i feel so bad for her.the only exception is her boyfriend, who she says is a loving, wonderful person - except hes deathly allergic to talking about mental illness. she thinks this is because *his* family was/is also shitty, and hes always just had trouble with that sort of issue. it makes him uncomfortable and he doesnt know how to deal with it. i realize that doesnt make him sound like a good person at all, but i think shes self aware enough that she would know if she was in an actually abusive/bad relationship. i honestly believe her when she says hes a good person (to the degree he can be with this in mind, whatever), but that doesnt change the fact that even *he* doesnt help her with this stuff, despite him knowing. and shes too...shes not a docile person, but shes very cautious about talking about mental illness. this isnt the kind of thing she would feel comfortable bringing up again to him.*so with all of this in mind*, after knowing this girl for maybe a month and a half, ive become her *only* support system.you do not have to remind me how absolutely horrible of an idea it is for someone to only have *one* person as a mental health support system, but the thing is, i dont know what to do. thats why im making this post, and why i felt all that context was necessary.im too tired to format this better, but as an aside, *no*, i have not developed an emotional dependency on her. ive taken steps mentally to not do that and i just want to make it clear that honestly, shes just a new friend to me, who just happens to need help on a regular basis. im not going to deny her that help.i mean, this girl is *literally the nicest person ive ever met*. like, i genuinely dont even think she has any bad qualities whatsoever. shes funny, sweet, caring...shes amazing. i genuinely enjoy talking to her as much as i do. i find it shocking she, of all people in the world, could think that anything is wrong with her. i could go on for hours. shes just so pure and good.so i talk to her and be a good friend, which is really what she needs in life in general - she tells me a lot how she doesnt think im even real because im so nice, but im honestly just acting like normal me and doing what any good person would. like i said, shes met bad, shitty people, and i care about her. so when she tells me that shes not real, or shes nothing but a waste of space who deserves to die, or that shes this terrible monster whos a burden just by existing and she should just jump off her balcony right now, i comfort her and help her. or i try to. the wall im running into, which i shouldve realized slightly sooner, is that there is only so much i *can* help. i have ocd, so my mentality subconsciously is to try and straight up *fix* problems, and ive realized i have a big tendency to try and make her feel better explicitly, instead of just talking to her like i would anyone else. it isnt necessarily *bad*, but i know that overdoing it would be, and i dont want to do that. i just want to help, but even when i do my best, sometimes it just doesnt affect her whatsoever and all i can do is be there for her. we watch movies on rabbit sometimes and were planning voice chats and stuff, but.the final bit of context here is that she owns the discord we met on. its a community full of people from different places, and shes friends with practically all of them. but her isolation is in that she feels uncomfortable telling people about her depression']\n",

      "['my way to my grandfather’s house for easter dinner, i’m just zoned out and staring out the window thinking to myself “just not today.. i’m tired and i don’t want to do this”..i know that everyone will be there, and they’ll all bring their boyfriends and girlfriends, they‘ll talk cute to each other, tell a story at the same time, adding in slightly more details, and hold hands under the table.. just the little things that remind you that you’re not in this alone..as i was about to walk in and prepared my best “everything is awesome” face and walked in with a smile, acting excited to be there. i even felt a little guilty for feeling this way; i am lucky to have a nice family..by now i’ve made my rounds and settle into the recliner in the living room with everyone else, having a few beers and listening to everyone talk.. i’m not saying much.. you know in movies when a bomb goes off or something, and it’s just that silence except for the slight ringing.. it was kind of like thatmy cousin and his girlfriend are holding hands sitting on the couch.. not in a pda type of way, but in a very loving way.. i really believe she was happy to be spending the day with him. she laughed at his jokes, they joked around and she’d hit him (playfully) whenever he said anything inappropriate.. i miss that then my little cousin walks in and he’s looking at my phone. i let him play with it and he is just in absolute aww; fascinated. he thinks siri is the most amazing thing, and he’s talking about how cool it was..what happened to that in my life? i miss being in complete aww, just taking in a moment of beauty.. you know what i see with a phone.. a bill.. a reminder that no one’s texted me, an outlet that means you are connected to the world, 24/7, never getting a break.. i check it.. no matches on tinder either aha why the fuck did i even sign up for that?..it comes time for dinner and we had your favorite.. cooked ham with that string bean casserole my aunt makes. it wasn’t as good as the years passed, but i think it was only because you weren’t there to remind me how good it was.. you would have psyched because i think she even added extra onion straws we’re eating around the table and i’m sitting at the head, because everyone wanted to sit next to their so’s, and there was only one chair at the end.. i volunteer as tribute, because why not? let them enjoy the time.. i know it’s not that big a deal, and they wouldn’t even mind, but things just happened that way..i think that’s where i made the mistake.. pretty much just asking to be talked to by those relatives who i only see three times a year..then it happened.. i hadn’t seen or talked to these relatives in a long time“hey dugefrsh, where’s [my girlfriend]? at her parents today? i made extra casserole just for her!”it’s kind of cliche to say especially because people say it a lot.. but it was like a scene from a movie..the kitchen becomes pretty quiet and she could tell she messed up and gave me a sad look to say i’m sorry. how was she supposed to know? it’s okayi play it off and just smile “ haha she’s doing well, her and her mother are on vacation this week i believe, so they’re out of state”the sigh of brief relief that swept over her face didn’t last long and she kept asking about her and telling me how cute she was and how she was so much fun to talk to..the line that hurt most was when she said she fit in perfect with our family..“she was perfect i know aunty”and it’s sort of my fault too i guess, i could have just told her that we’re not together anymore and been done with it, but i didn’t want to embarrass her finally my dad coughed and i told her we were no longer seeing each other anymore..play it off coy, everyone gets back to chatting and the situation rolls over.. i don’t usually drink a red wine, but we were out of white and i didn’t want a beer. i sat there at the head of the table playing with a bowl of jellybeans, and i even picked out all the black ones and put them off to the side, sort of like i was saving them for you.. i can’t believe you liked those you weirdo hahai finally had a moment without thinking about you today though.. the bruins game was on and was a welcome distraction; that and the alcohol was helpingwhen the game finishes up all the kids want to watch frozen.. i can’t do that..when i would sing do you wanna build a snowman to you and you’d laugh.. i can’t do it..thankfully though my parents wanted to leave.. as i’m in the back seat again, the pulsing of the passing street lamps make it a little hard to close my eyes.. when i’m staring at the stars, it’s such a lame, grandiose and romanticized way of thinking, but i knew they were the same stars that you were looking at.. it hit me that that was one time i was in aww.. looking at stars with you..after i finish this drink, i’m gonna try and get some rest though..if i’m lucky i’ll just pass out and don’t have to cry too long..maybe i’ll start the moving on process?.. it’s never taken me this long to get over someone..maybe i’ll try it in the morning.. maybe tomorrow will be the day i beat this stupid depression']\n",

      "['my father is currently in jail while i sit here waiting to find out if i have to testify. im a survivor of adult rape by who i thought was a very good long term friend.  i have cptsd following years of neglect, abuse, homelessness, and hunger. the abuse and neglect started when i was 6 and my sister died, and it continued escalating until there was so much bitter hatred between myself and my family i was forced out at 17. i was angry, volatile, scared and had little impulse control. i hadnt processed the levels of abuse and slowly unraveled it during my early adult years. i just didnt care about my safety. i basically fled to another state where i jumped around from place to place. i made some amazing memories and some...not so amazing ones. i cant say i regret it all, but im amazed im alive. there were nights i slept with some nice enough stranger just so i had a bed to sleep in. cut to a few years later: i moved back to my home state with a boy whod been in love with me for years. he was such a good, caring friend. i thought, finally, things are changing. we lived together for two years and i became pregnant. somehow, he morphed into an alcoholic, lying to me on a daily basis, cheating on me and leaving me when i was 8 months along. it was probably there all along, and i just was too willfully blind to see it. so, i had my beautiful son and moved back in with my narcissistic mother and was a single mother for two years. during that time, i suffered terrible post-partum. when i went to a psychiatrist, i was incorrectly diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put immediately on a high dose of lithium. the side effects i experienced were beyond horrible. he refused to see me immediately when i begged to be taken off of it. i legitimately thought i was losing my mind. i hallucinated, i couldnt sleep but i was so tired all of the time. my emotions were a roller coaster. i went to a counselor to talk, and while breaking down about the medication and the exhaustion, about the abuse and the loneliness -  she determined i was suicidal even though that was never even close to being said. to be fair, she was very new and im sure i made her worried, but its hard to forgive her for what came next. i was arrested from there and put into a psychiatric hospital for a week. my mother refused to visit with my son, and i lost my job. i was force fed antipsychotics that made me hallucinate further, and wasnt allowed a xanax even when surrounded by schizophrenic patients who urinated on my clothes and threw a chair at me. let me tell you - the movies where they seem to exaggerate sane people being stuck in places like that, having meds pushed down their throat and being treated like any natural reaction is them having a psychotic break - it is too accurate. on top of everything, i was injured at work and have herniated discs in my neck, which at 29 causes me daily chronic pain. i refuse to rely on narcotics, but i cant do as much as i used to. and i used to do a lot. my energy levels are horrible and i hate the way i look. i suppose thats normal when youre a skinny teenager being told youre fat by your parents. however - by all accounts, my life is a good one now. my financial problems are working themselves out. i have an amazing husband and my son is 5 and starting kindergarten and such an amazing little ball of joy and sweetness. i have a decent job which allows me some flexibility. i have a car and a bed and three awesome cats and i dont ever have to worry about not eating. i think i appreciate the small stuff so much more now. i just... i feel so disconnected. i jump back and forth between anxiety and depression']\n",

      "['my mum doesnt give a shit about me and my mental health. im not saying this because i feel like she doesnt care, im saying this because of various reasons, like: when i had my very first mental breakdown and spent 15 days crying in bed and sleeping without moving the only thing she did was telling me \"think about starving kids in africa theyre doing worst than you\" and then put the dog on my bed instead of conforting me herself. at that point i asked her to see a therapist. she allowed me to do that but, like she always does, she started to make me feel extremely guilty about the fact that we couldnt afford even that upon the other expences and telling me things like \"we have to pay your therapist so i dont know if well have money to go grocery shopping\". we had money for both since my father a month later bought a fucking vehicle for 3.000€, but still. shes always been like that.at first i though she didnt know what to do with depression and how to deal with someone who is depressed (which is very strange, considering her older brother passed away in an accident when she was around my age, which is 21/22, and that is the kind of thing that would probably make you feel depressed i guess), so i just forgave her and tried to pick myself up the best i could. then my brother had his breakdown, started hearing voices that werent there, stopped sleeping, started yelling in the middle of the night and writing stuff on the walls with a pen. of course my anxiety at this point got super bad, cause thing were basically falling apart with my ex, i had to give exams, i couldnt function and i was waking up at seven am by my mother who asked me to scrape off the words my brother wrote on the walls \"as quietly as you can\". i did. while having and anxiety crisis all the time i spent on the wall with a sponge erasing threats against every single member of my family of \"gutting us like animals\". then she became, like, *the best mum ever.* always there to give him support, always rushing over him and worrying, asking him stuff, trying her best to be close to him. and i got so mad, cause she was capable of being next to my brother, then why did she teated me the way she did in the past? then i realized. of course she didnt stayed close to me when i was ill: everything was going great with her. she only worried about me when she needed comfort and if i couldnt provide that because i was sick then she would \"worry\" (by which i mean making me feel guilty because i couldnt take no more). i went to live with my grandma for january cause i was super done with dying in anxiety and crying three hours per day when i wad okay, i needed a place to stay calm or i would just go insane. she helped me pack and gave me the key of the car, told me to have a \"nice trip\" and went back inside to check my brother.i went to my grandmas house crying hysterically and i didnt stop for hours. i just cried and cried until i was too exhausted and i slept. the morning after i told my ex-boyfriend that i was way too depressed to get out of bed and i couldnt see him and i was very sorry. he got angry (yeah, he was emotionally abusive as fuck, maybe one day ill write the story but he fucked me up pretty badly mentally), and i just shutted my phone up, got into bed and started writing suicide notes to my friends and my grandma. once i finished i realized that i couldnt go to the bathroom, let alone go to the top of a building and jump off.so i decide that i need medicine and i need therapy asap. where i live we have free healthcare, so i ask my mum to come with me to take the appointment with the psychiatrist. he saw me, diagnosed me with major depressive disorder and we started with medicines.my mum never asked me how it was. she never asks about medicines, my health, how im doing. the medicine arent working still and i never took that many pills in a lifetime, but she doesnt even notice that. she discovered i wad being medicated when i told my older brother about it in the living room and she reacted with a \"okay\". just an okay.i told her my diagnosis when i was hysterically crying because i just broke things off with my ex and she kept talking to me about what my father did that day that was *so wrong and shitty * she just didnt care that i was sobbing in the car next to her. what she told me? \"oh you think *im* not depressed?\"then just kept on telling me how bad she was feeling and how life was cruel to her.meanwhile here i am, all alone at 21 years of age, with basically nothing cause my parents managed to burn down every single piece of property they couldve left to us, with a broken brain since i was so little i litteraly cannot remember when it started precisely, five attempted suicides. and my mum just wants to talk about how she fucked up her own life and she feels miserable about it. after i told my psychiatrist this he told me to go live to my grandmas, because my house was way too toxic and i could never improve there. i kept staying there for a while cause i felt guilty about living my brothers and my mum alone, but then my little brother (the one that probably has schizophrenia, but nobody in my family is willing to accept the problem and do something about it) almost punched me in the face because i asked him how he was doing.i am very petite girl with zero muscles cause i hate sports, my brother has harms as big as my head basically. he couldve busted badly my face in a matter of seconds, but luckly for me i have good reflexes, so i avoided it for the most part. he bruised my face though.i told my mum what happened via text and she didnt reply. she didnt say anything. than she said that i should be patient with my brother whom is *very sick and very angry.* that was the day i moved into my grandmas house and my mum thinks it is only because i am mad at her for no reason. like my whole life revolves around how she feels and what she wants. because she taught me that i can never feel bad or sad or angry when she is, she is the important one that needs to talk. i am the one that is supposed to listen to her problems since i was in elementary school. she litteraly took me from class when i was 8 to show me how badly my father punched her in the face. im sorry for the long posts, but i have a lot of shit im going through and im basically quitting every relationship with my mum whatsoever because of this. i just need her to give me money, cause she is supposed to and she promised me and i am in uni and cannot work because of my depression (my psychiatrist basically begged me not to find a job cause it would only make me feel worst). when ill feel better i will work my butt of and be indipendent and never speak to her ever again. but the fact is that i am dropping someone that to me was my *hero.* i love my mum so much, she can be kind and amazing and she protected me when my father wanted to kick the shit out of me, she tried to raise me alone the best she could and i just cant leave her behind without feeling like i have lost everything in my life. i feel like i hav nothing and i need to build an empire all by myself without the help of anybody, while having no arms and no idea of how to build said empire. everyday i think that dying would be the best option, but i cant die, i promised my best friend we would climb mount depression together and get to the top together.i just feel stuck in life. everyone that shouldve loved me no matter what just disappointed me again and again. my mum broke me to pieces and she doesnt even care. she has two sons and a doll that she can use however she wants, thats it. it sucks. it feels shitty to know that the person that choose to put you into this world just left you completely alone and was never there when you really needed that. now all she does is call me from time to time and tries to make me feel guilty about not helping her in our house and wanting to be here to do nothing. she knows i am depressed']\n",

      "['my head. in october i went to a thanksgiving dinner 30 minutes away from home to my dad’s friends house. the people that were there were me, my sisters, my dad, my aunt and uncle (whom i don’t see very often) and my dad’s friend. i remember saying to myself that i didn’t want to go. at all. with my anxiety currently, being that far away from home without a quick escape (as it was 30 minutes away) then it made it harder. i wanted to make my dad proud and actually go to a family gathering for once so i sucked it up. the drive i was anxious but still able to be calm. i didn’t eat before going and i didn’t get a good amount of sleep the night before which is a precursor to trigger my anxiety. i should have stayed home. it was too much too soon. when we go there is when the anxiety kicked in. i knew i would get asked about my mom and how were getting along and i’d have to talk about it. she left the house in the summer of 2015 after her and my dad weren’t getting along and we thought it was best she leave due to her emotional abuse and narcissistic tendencies. it did not go well. she accused us of kicking her out when her father was the one who took her out of the house. anyways i think talking about my mom just made my anxiety worse. i could feel the anxiety rising and the thoughts start. “what if i get sick here in front of all these people?” “what if they think i’m weird for having a panic attack?” only a hour there and i wanted to tell my dad to drive me home. i didn’t because i couldn’t be weak again and just go home. i also didn’t want my dad to get mad and to ruin his time like i’ve done before. i sat on the couch and had a full panic attack. people know to leave my alone when i get like this. when im anxious i freeze up and can’t talk. i can only focus on one thing like a tv show. my sisters would come up and talk to me but another thing when i get anxious is my throat feels like its’ closing and i gag. i didn’t want them to see me do this. i would just nod and pretend i was okay. i couldn’t even think of dinner and having to eat in front of everyone. i just sucked it up while i could feel myself having what felt like a panic attack then it would subside then start up and then subside then start up. like hills or mountains. peaks and valleys. the best way i can describe it. absolute hell. i felt trapped with no way out and so far away from home. i remember going to the bathroom even though i hate going in other people’s houses. praying it wasn’t a bad poop (which would lead me to think i was sick and trigger my emetophobia) it was fine so that eased my mind. i ate what i could. some turkey and potatoes with a fake smile on my face, nodding and trying to converse all while feeling like my body was exploding on the inside from all the anxiety and adrenaline. again i’d be okay for a short while then it would spike. peaks and valleys. again, best way to describe it. it was finally winding down and my dad wanted to stay longer but i said “fuck no. i need to go home now.” on the drive home all i could think about was the anxiety. i’m literally having anxiety right now typing this just thinking about it. i was scared i was gonna throw up or faint or have a heart attack. dad was talking to me but all i was focused on was my anxiety and my body. i just wanted to get home to my room. i gagged violently in the car as my throat felt tight and my mouth dry. this would happen whenever my anxiety gets so intense. it was pretty bad when i was a kid. when we got home i had the worse depersonalization ever. my room looked foreign. i felt like i was in a daze. i assume my brain was overloading from all the anxiety. this only made it worse. i went to the bathroom and changed into my pyjamas and i laid down, put my computer and tv on and rode it out. that night was when it all started. the next day i had what i call a “panic attack hangover” i felt so tired, my muscles were tense. i slept horrible. waking up every so often with my heart racing in the middle of a anxiety attack. it’s like my body was full of adrenaline still. i was happy to be in my bed and my comfort zone when this was happening. my bedroom has been my safe haven for the past couple of years where i felt safe when i was anxious. my dad made food for dinner and even though anxiety, which depletes my appetite, was still present, i ate. i was still anxious. just wanted my bed and to lay down and watch tv on my laptop with all my comfort. a few hours later i had diarrhea. cue my brain into thinking i had a stomach virus that i caught or got sick from the food the night before. i rationally knew it was from all the anxiety as the anxiety puts my digestive tract into overdrive. i knew that but my irrational brain as i like to call it, didn’t. i was convinced i was sick which then put my anxiety into overdrive once again. all i felt for the next couple days was anxiety. i was scared to eat as maybe i was sick and food would make me throw up. i stuck to my bland diet which i do when i think i’m sick when really it’s anxiety fucking with my head. slowly the anxiety passed after a week. moments like that typically do even though this particular time what with thanksgiving and how bad that experience was, usually last about a week. i had my first therapist appointment on the 26th of october. the anxiety from thanksgiving was gone. i still had the thoughts of “what if” but those were always with my when i left the house. i was excited to start therapy again. the session went good. it was really just to get to know me. what meds im on ect. i told her about thanksgiving and how awful it was. she told me that it was good that i got through it. i agreed but i also thought to myself that i never want to feel that way again.i stopped to get a bagel after and went home. went on the internet and read a book. my sister got home and offered to make us some pasta. i was so tired so i told her if i fall asleep, wake me when it’s ready. i feel asleep so fast without even realizing it. what felt like 2 seconds later my sister woke up me up and told me dinner was ready. i started to feel that anxiety dread again. usually when i take naps in the daytime i wake up a little anxious and groggy. apparently my brain thought it was time to freak out to the extreme because i felt the daze feeling and the depersonalization again. i walked down and got myself some pasta even though it look revolting because once again, my anxiety gets rid of any appetite i have when it rears it’s ugly head. i ate the pasta and turned on netflix and grey’s anatomy. i put on something i’m familiar with when i’m anxious. it’ sort of a weird coping mechanism. i don’t know. this is when it allll started.i spent the night convinced that i woke up feeling like that because i was sick. always go to that conclusion. i hate my brain. i spent all night in and out of panic attacks just like i did during thanksgiving. i thought “oh hell no. i’m not feeling like this again.” and it sort of spiralled from there. i felt everything. afraid to eat because i might get sick which caused more anxiety. loose stools from anxiety even though i know anxiety caused it but more convincing to my irrational brain that i was sick. it wasn’t anxiety. this kept happening. it all snowballed and i wanted it to stop. for some reason i started to feel like i did when i was 13. there was this one point where something like this happened that was similar. i would gag and get afraid to eat. i dry heaved over the sink. my anxiety was awful. my mom was there and she would help and cut me up apples to get me to eat. i would lay on the couch next to her. i started to say “i want my mom.” i thought she would know how to make it better. like she did when i was 13. i do not know where this thought came from. my mom hadn’t lived with us for over year and we barely saw each other. i don’t know why my brain thought that she would fix this. i do remember that when i would say something like “if i eat this i’ll probably throw up or it will come out of me and make me think im sick.” and she would always say “no you’re fine.” and that would help. i ended up fine. my dad and sisters would tell me everything is okay as well but it wasn’t the same. i’m not sure why i felt like my mom would make this better but i did.   i literally felt like i was 13 again and back in that episode i went through. i no longer had control over my thoughts and my body. i was anxious as hell and hated the physical symptoms that came form that and i wanted it all to stop. i think i broke. i was gagging while trying to eat which made me think i was sick. i got scared i was going to get malnourished and have to be tube fed. i would text my mom and she would tell me no, that’s not possible. i would get heart palpitations and think i was having a heart attack. i had a palpitation on the toilet and i was scared of going on the toilet. my stomach was a mess with loose stools due to anxiety but convinced i was sick and then fed on that i wasn’t absorbing my food and i would end up, once again as i mentioned, malnourished and have to be tube fed. i was texting my mom with every symptom i felt. the anxiety  felt like i was losing control of my mind and the symptoms of the anxiety made me feel like i was losing control of my body. i was afraid i was dying or had some sort of disease. i started looking up all these symptoms on google and asking my mom if i had this disease or this condition. i was afraid i was gonna have a heart attack or faint. i couldn’t eat or sleep. it’s like my brain stopped working. i cried. i would try to tell my sisters and dad that i needed my mom. i wanted her back home. all of us together again. they told me no. it’s not healthy. mom and dad don’t get alone anymore. were here and we can help you. mom’s not far away. i told them they don’t help like my mom does. they took offence to that. i got mad and stopped talking to them because they wouldn’t let my mom come home. i felt like a child. i felt out of control. why was i acting like this? i was still feeling all the symptoms of anxiety. still worried i was dying. this never stopped. this scared me. why was i acting like this? was i going crazy? was i having a mental breakdown? i started to do things to get my dad’s attention to see how bad i was without my mom. i remembered i cut myself after being self harm free for over 2 years. at that time i didn’t care. i just wanted to stop this anxiety. my mom suggested that i go to the hospital. i agreed even though i knew i would get traumatized. i went through this when i was 12. i had to go to the hospital and i remember sitting in the waiting room. this was back in 2002 and there was a breakout of some virus that caused vomiting. the norwalk virus i think. i remember my dad took me and while in the waiting room i kept telling him while sobbing that i had to go home. i was gonna catch something here. being at the hospital again this time brought all that back and it was like i was reliving it all again. i felt 12 again. not 27. why? it scared me. at the hospital they gave me 1mg of ativan. explained to them about what was happening what with my anxiety and me thinking i was dying or had a disease. i stayed until the morning and saw the crisis councillor. she explained that parents spilt up and it’s hard and that my mom wasn’t far and i could talk to her or call her on the phone. i felt good hearing that. i felt better. i went home and felt good. i hated that i self harmed though. i hate that i put my dad and sisters through that. i went to sleep feeling good. i can move ahead. nope.i woke up in a panic attack and all the thoughts came back. the health anxiety. the symptoms of anxiety. my thoughts went back to needing my mom again. i started acting out and throwing things to get my dad to see i wasn’t okay and needed my mom. why was i acting like this? i felt confused and scared and my thoughts made no sense. i couldn’t think or make decisions. i couldn’t calm down. i was having panic attack and i couldn’t eat or sleep. i was googling all my symptoms from anxiety and diagnosing myself with everything.i needed my mom like i had when i was 13 and this would stop. my mom decided to come over and stay a few nights. it was awful. i was till asking her about every symptom. i was gagging at food and scared of malnutrition and she kept saying no. it’s just your anxiety. this time my mom’s words weren’t helping. i’d lost control and i was going to feel like this the rest of my life. i was terrified. i stopped talking to my friends or going on social media. all i thought 24/7 was anxiety, anxiety, anxiety. what illness or disease i could have. the heart palpitations, gagging, not being able to eat, or sleep, diarrhea, sweating, shaking, scared i would faint. it was all i was focused on. i couldn’t focus on tv or movies. i couldn’t read. i couldn’t sit still. the only relief i got was when i went to sleep with the help of my seroquel. while my mom was there it was hell. i wanted to convinced my dad and sisters she could come home. she could sleep on the couch or back in her bed with dad. have it all like it was before. i dont know why i was saying this. my sisters and my dad don’t talk to my mom and her being in the house was tense for all of them. my mom felt uncomfortable there and my sisters didn’t want her there either. my mom had to go back to her parents house where she had been living since she left home and i thought “oh hell no.” she’s staying. i stopped talking and stared at the wall in hopes that my dad and sisters would see that i was bad off and needed my mom. i don’t know why i was doing this but like i said i had lost control of my mind. she had to go and i just laid there begging for them to see. i just cried. my grandparents came to pick her up and my grandfather and my dad don’t get along. they got into a physical altercation a few years prior. i heard yelling and screaming downstairs. my little sister was pissing me off. she kept telling me my mom couldn’t come home and i was being stupid. she called my crazy and all. she was yelling at my mom telling her to leave. i remember getting up and walking downstairs and i punched her in the face. i hate that i did this. we’ve gotten in fights before. we ended up fighting and my dad tore us apart. i remember just flinging myself on the hardwood floor. i felt like i didn’t know why this was happening. my mom left. i went back to my room and cried and still felt the anxiety. i started googling again. i’d post on reddit looking for reassurance that i wasn’t dying. all the while my sisters and dad distances themselves from me. i told them to leave me alone and i hated them when inside i wanted help and i just didn’t know what was wrong with me. i was scared. why was i acting like this? why was i feeling like this? was this is it? was i going crazy? i would look up the symptoms of going crazy. that night i went downstairs and told my dad i was leaving. i wanted my mom and they wouldn’t let me so bye! i didn’t want this i just wanted to know what was happening to me. i put on clothes and packed a bag and i hid in the woods hoping that would get their attention. i sat there for 20 minutes and nobody cared. i remember walking back home and i had a heart palpitation and i thought “no” i can’t have a heart attack and then my anxiety skyrocketed again. it wouldn’t stop. i was in a constant state of fear and anxiety. i felt my body and mind were on high alert. when i got home. i just laid on the floor in the living room. i called my mom over and over and told her nobody was seeing how bad i was. i was calling my grandfather to pick me up so i could go stay with them. my mom kept telling me to wake my dad up and ask him for help. i said no he doesn’t get it. my mind was set that only my mom could fix this. i went upstairs and slammed my door and self harmed again. my dad came in and shook me and screamed at me asking me why i was doing this. i didn’t know. i didn’t know what was happening to me. i just wanted the anxiety to stop. i refused to go to the hospital again and re-traumatize myself for the 3rd time. after that i knew that my mom wasn’t coming home. just wasn’t happening. i was still feeling anxious as hell and googling everything. i was not sleeping well and not eating. the anxiety was awful. i had never felt this anxiety in my life ever. maybe when i was 13 but not as bad. i felt like i was back there again. everyday i was terrified i would throw up or have a heart attack. i was having multiple panic attacks a day. i kept telling my mom i had to get out of this shit hole where nobody cared about me. (they did.) i told my dad he wasnt gonna get my rent. (i’m on disability and i do pay my rent) he got mad. i said fuck this i’m moving out with mom. she looked into it and got us appointment to sign the lease. i thought “okay, mom’s gonna fix me. i’ll feel better.” nope. while waiting for the process, my sisters and dad barely talked to me. i was still scared of throwing up or having a heart attack. i was scared that not eating much would lead me to malnutrition. i was afraid to get up and go to the bathroom or take a bath because i didn’t want to get my heart rate up or faint due to not eating much. i was constantly aware of every physical sensation due to the anxiety. i was in a constant state of it and hyper sensitive. i saw my doctor and i was gagging so hard in the office and i thought “fuck fuck why wont this stop.” he prescribed a antacid to take because the anxiety was causing this. i thought it wasn’t and i had some disease. i noticed i’d lost 10 pounds since i was there last in april. this was november. first through was “fuck im malnourished and im gonna end up on a feeding tube” i couldn’t even hold a conversation with him because all i felt was anxiety and i wanted to get out of there.going on social media made me anxious. watching a show i didn’t see before made me anxious. i started getting anxious seeing pictures of people i was friends with and pictured being in public with them and having a anxiety attack. everything was causing a panic attack. the day came to sign the lease. i was focused on living with my mom and not feeling this anxiety hell again. my mom and grandfather were coming to pick me up and the only thing i was thinking of was my anxiety. would i faint because im actively walking and i haven’t eaten? what if i have a heart attack? what if i have palpations? in the car i was focused on my chest and how it was beating. my mom trying to talk to me and me just saying things back. sitting in the lease office only thinking about if i was gonna have a heart attack in front of these people. i was not in the right mindset to be making this huge life change. i signed the lease and only cared about getting home.then something happened. i hoped that the lease wouldn’t go through because the anxiety was starting to lift. i slowly got back to eating. i could sleep. i started talking to my dad again. i felt better. it had passed.my mom texted me and told me we got approved. i wanted to tell her that its okay now. i’m fine. i didn’t. i was scared she would get mad and think that i didn’t want to move in with her. i had dug this hole while anxious and not thinking straight. what did i do? it all became clear to me that my mom is emotionally abusive and anything she does it had to benefit her. it was better we lived apart. i could think properly now. but now i couldn’t let my mom down and do what’ best for me. i told her i was excited. now i’m here. it’s been almost 6 months living with my mom in our two bedroom apartment. i walk on eggshells around her to make sure i don’t do anything wrong to piss her off. she constantly tells me that her kids don’t talk to her and my sisters are bad humans. she asks my dad to help her with money and to bring her things. she’s always asking who i’m talking to and if i’m talking shit about her to my sisters. she yells at me because they don’t talk to her and i being me, have to try to fix it. i just want everyone to get along. she gets mad if i put something back in the fridge the wrong way. her moods can be up and down. im starting to remember why she had to move out in the first place. she can’t be there for me like she was when i was 13. i didn’t realize until now that she was only there so she could look good. that she was the caring mother. when in reality she tells me to stop worrying and get over it. now i’m in this mess and worse then ever. i miss my old home. i went back there and it’s not the same. my dad has a roommate with him. the house looks different and it’s not my home anymore. the day i moved out nobody was home because they didn’t want to see my mom so i never had a proper goodbye to the house or my sisters and dad. i just left. i followed up with my doctor and ekg’s and blood tests and all normal. my health anxiety still hasn’t gone away since that time despite the doctor saying i’m fine.nothing in my life is the same anymore. i feel like a new person. somebody i dont know. i feel like i was just placed here and now i have to learn how to function. my agoraphobia has flared up again. after all the worrying about something being wrong with me is still there. i worry i still have a disease or i’m gonna faint or anything if i leave my room. my surrounding feel foreign. i feel like my world has turned on it’s axis. i don’t see my sisters because they do not get along with my mom so they don’t come over. i can’t leave the house to see them cause of my issues. i miss my dad and how much we got along. he only comes over if i need something but i hate bothering him. we barely talk. he told me that i can call him anytime and he would pick me up. my anxiety is still high when out of my room. i also get flashbacks of that time when i see my sisters or my dad. i associate them with what happened. my anxiety then spikes.i don’t know how to get past this. how did i get here? how do i move forward? i feel like i can’t move from what happened. why did i act like that? what happened? what triggered it? am i crazy? was i crazy? i miss my old life. it wasn’t perfect but now i don’t know who i am anymore. i don’t know what to do. i have good days when my mom’s at work and i’m home alone and i could take a walk or sit on the balcony but i dont because the fear of that anxiety or those anxiety symptoms will come back. i’ve become a recluse in my room. i sit on my bed and watch tv and go on my computer. i only leave my room to eat and bathe. the eating this is still scary. will i gag like i did during that time? am i eating enough so i don’t get malnourished? it’s like all my life is now is what happened in november. i have flashbacks like ptsd. i can’t move on. i’m afraid a panic attack will trigger it all over again so i have avoided doing anything that might cause anxiety or those symptoms because i can’t feel like i did then. i can’t.if somebody took the time to read all this and make me understand exactly what happened, that would help. i’m on waiting list for therapy. i went back to my dads house two weeks ago because i told my mom i wanted to move back. i spent the weekend there. my mom hated me. she told me i was a terrible daughter for abandoning her with the rent and bills. when i was at my dads i was back to feeling like i did back in november. all the feelings came back. all that happened. it also just wasn’t the same. my sisters moved out and it was my dad and some stranger. this wasn’t home anymore. i couldn’t live there. i went back to my apartment with my mom. i feel like i have no control. i feel stuck.i feel depressed']\n",

      "['my successful regimen is not guaranteed to be yours, but it doesnt hurt to share this experience with your doctor and ask if something similar might also help.) &#x200b;i have suffered from depression for most of my life. i only started getting treatment in my 20s, and its been about 17 years since i started different treatments, off and on.about 5 years ago, i was put on paxil. it worked really well for a while, then it not only stopped working, but i started to get really severe anhedonia. i basically just felt like \"whats the point?\" about anything i could do for fun.recently, my depression and anxiety started to come back severely. i went to seek treatment, mentioned how anhedonia was a huge part of my life now, and how paxil basically stopped working before i weened myself off of it, a couple of years ago.the doctor prescribed me to excitalopram, and i was already off and on taking agomelatine at night to help with sleeping regularly, as well as to lessen my anxiety in the next day. the combination has been working well to control the severity of my depressive episodes, but nothing really helped with my anxiety.i also have adhd, and because im not a kid anymore, its hard to have that taken seriously. i live in china, which makes getting medicine for adhd extremely difficult. the gov is afraid of people abusing stimulants, so the process of getting stimulants for treatment is rigorous to the point that most doctors wont even try.so, with that taken into account, i pushed my psychologist to consider medicinal treatment (at our session the month before, he tried telling me to practice mindfulness and focusing exercises, which doesnt help for anhedonia aggravated lack of motivation.) he prescribed me to haloperidol.man, what a difference. the first day, i felt like i could sleep for a million years, i was worried it was going to be a failure because i couldnt even keep my eyes open.the second day, i took it before bed, then i woke up a bit groggy. after i got up and had a shower, i felt much better, and more importantly, i had actual feelings.i excitedly considered writing some music, and this is where my anhedonia and adhd would normally sap my will to do anything. id normally start thinking of all the stuff id have to do to set up my music equipment, all the wires thatd need to be untangled, and how id have to put it all back again after. then id think about how my music isnt really loved by anyone, what am i writing it for? why am i doing it? who cares if i do or i dont? (this is the combination of anedonias \"nothing matters anyway\" and adhds \"lets flood you with a thousand thoughts and make you forget why you even had the thought in the first place.\")none of this happened. it tried to for a second, then i just said \"fuck it, this is my body, i can make it do these things\" (getting all the stuff out and setting it up), so i started doing it.within an hour i had a song, then another, then another, etc. the next day was the same, i was in chat rooms about music, talking about my hobby oh my god, its my hobby, i have a hobby, a thing i love doing!!!. sorry for the caps, but this realization hit me.its only been a week, but the effects have been stable. im not super excited and hyped up, i can just think of doing something and start doing it. and as im doing it, i dont constantly have this negative voice devaluing what im doing or sapping all the joy out of it. im not plagued by a suicidal cheer leader who wants nothing more than to make me give up and lay there till i die.i say all of this because i know what depression feels like. theres always the chance that ill have to adjust my meds in the future as one med becomes less effective or whatever. all i can say is that for the first time in a while, i feel like hope actually exists in the world.im glad i talked to my psychologist about dealing with adhd. i havent treated adhd since i was a late teen, and i only treated it for a short period of my life. had i not brought up the topic of adulthood adhd, i wouldnt have found out that an antipsychotic medication (haloperidol) could quiet that shitty nagging \"nothing you do matters\" voice in my head and let me reconnect with the things i used to enjoy.i hope whatever your method of action, please believe me when i tell you. ive spent the last 4 years of my life being absolutely certain that depressed or not depressed, joy was a lie i used to tell myself and id somehow figured out that nothing joyful was ever real.here i am, only a week later and its like the heaviest darkest fog has been removed from in front of my eye, or pulled out of my heart.i hope you find the will to keep trying to beat your depression']\n",

      "['my early 20s. since my teen years, probably starting around 17 or 18, ive been on a rollercoaster of ups and downs, each of which usually last a few months at a time, although it varies. my initial, long ago feelings of depression stemmed from not knowing how to talk or interact with girls, having been a sheltered youth that went to an all boys high school. i went through several years thinking i wasnt good enough for anyone, feeling immense loneliness even though i had plenty of guy friends that truly liked and cared about me.well i finally learned a few years ago kinda how to get girls. and when this happened my rollercoaster went to one of its highest \"ups\" ever. i was meeting and sleeping with girls, finally. i loved it.  last year, i met a girl who became absolutely infatuated with me. she loved and adored me. she told me this numerous times. we were perfectly compatible in bed. perfectly compatible. at the point of meeting her i had already had several partners and she was the first one that made me truly enjoy sex. she desired me. i desired her. the whole time i was \"with\" her (with in quotations because i never dated her, we kinda just texted a lot and had sex on the weekends) i basically treated her like shit. took her for granted. i thought,subconsciously, \"look how much this girl loves and wants me, i must be the shit, i dont really need her cause i can get any girl i want.\" the confidence boost of having someone love me so much and think i was so attractive made me think any girl could feel the same way about me. so after about 9 months, i told her i wanted to stop seeing her.she was devastated. begged me not to go. i said no, were not meant for each other. i didnt see her for 2 months over the summer. i had no girls, and i missed her, but i was still confident in myself. i still thought i was attractive, had a lot to offer. but i missed her. i realized i made a mistake. and i texted her saying so. and she said sorry, but i wasted too much time on you, someone who constantly told me that they didnt love me, so now i started seeing someone else. so now shes gone. its been several months since then, and i havent talked to her since, besides one little hiccup in the middle where we talked for a day, but its irrelevant to this post. i still think about how good i had it, and i still miss her every day, and i always think about how stupid i was to throw it away. in the moment i didnt think i even liked her, but i guess its true that you dont know what you have till its gone. well if this was all i had to deal with, i would be ok because eventually i believe i would be able to find another girl. but over the summer, i started losing my hair, rapidly. im 22. i know this isnt stress related because 1. early onset baldness runs in my family, and 2. i started a drug to help my hair loss (which i had noticed last year before it started to get really bad) and stopped the drug because i felt like it was not working. well. my hair had become dependent on the drug, and began to really recede and thin out rapidly. so. im balding at 22. i am a tall, skinny, very pale, babyface guy who cant grow a beard and has a large skull with a narrow face. i cannot pull off the bald look. at all. i can look at pictures of myself from 4 months ago and see a very noticeable difference in how i look. i used to be a youthful looking attractive guy who got compliments from girls all the time. now i feel like an old man, in a matter of months. i have zero confidence left. absolutely none. i spend all day every day thinking about my hairline, taking and analyzing pictures of myself, going to the bathroom every 20 minutes just to see if my hair looks ok. i feel, in my heart, that my dating life is over. i feel like no girl will ever want me again. i was so confident in myself and my looks 4 months ago, and now, nothing.  this makes my regret for ending my relationship increase 1000x. i had someone that loved me for me, and was so animalistically attracted to me, and i was to her, and now its done forever. i will never have that again. and if i made a different decision a few months ago i couldve had it for the rest of my life, even if i was bald.people will tell me to lower my standards, but im attracted to what im attracted to. my standards used to be attainable. now i feel like theyre not. and my hair situation will never get better, only worse. im 22 and i feel like the prime of my life is over.all these things have led me to being depressed']\n",

      "['my life. its been sort of ingrained in me to be humble by my parents, and i still believe its a good trait to have. but ever since high school ive been especially hard on myself, because during my freshman year i went full on slacker and my grades went to shit; more zeros than anything. after that my family moved and i worked hard to rebuild myself, doubling down on the mentality that im an idiot/asshole, and it worked. i even got into my first relationship with someone who was objectively a shitty person who hurt me horribly at the end, yet i still miss her. sorry for my writing being all over the place, im kind of having a mental break and typing helpstheres a little backstory. my mom dated an asshole we lived with for eight years who verbally abused us both and would hit her. one day when i was at a day camp over the summer i kind of snapped. i dont know how to describe it other than a psychotic break or something. i randomly became horribly paranoid of everything. i remember sitting in the hall of the school that camp was held at, a totally empty hall with no obstructions to my line of sight, shivering in fear of something i couldnt really explain to anyone. (this was the summer after my 5th grade) when i got home that day i didnt want to shower because i thought a bug would fly into one of my orifices and lay eggs or something, which was somewhat justified as we had an earwig problem. i wouldnt brush my teeth because i was too worried about swallowing a bit of toothpaste and being poisoned. when i washed my hands, i kept my mouth closed out of fear that soap would splash in there, yet i still washed them excessively, and i mean like every five minutes excessively. even my moms boyfriend, who was ocd himself, was getting pissed at me. i would hoard spit in my cheek rather than swallow if i thought there was anything toxic in there. this went on for a good couple of years throughout middle school, where i was more concerned about imaginary things killing me than my grades, or at least thats how i like to justify it. by eighth and ninth grade i was a pariah, a class clown who tried too hard to make friends, and i dont remember having any.so maybe thats why i miss being in a toxic relationship. maybe if i build up someone in my mind like i did with her, i can feel happy about myself because im with her. but that wasnt the case, i constantly worried about where we stood even at the best of our relationship. she wanted to marry me, but circumstances kept us from seeing each other and i always worried what she was doing. was she seeing someone else? that kind of thing. and i was right. she got back with her ex and told me we needed a break, and that shed let me know her choice in a month. that broke me. i was so fucking miserable i broke it off with her totally, leaving casualties in the form of a big rant over the phone about the douche she was dating and all but telling her to go to hell. it was the first time i had stood up to someone like that, and it lasted. i was an easygoing guy (on the outside anyway) until my senior year, when this happened, and i spent the rest of high school in a state of...idk, not really apathy but sort of defensively. i ignored our mutual friends assuming they had all sided with her, but i did end up dating a girl we both knew. we got too serious while i was still resentful over my ex, and it was this attitude that drove her away too.months later when im reconnecting with an old friend, i learn that, in fact, a number of my friends had sided with me but i never bothered trying to approach them. fuck. i spent my last year of school miserable for no good reason, i didnt even go to my prom or walk at graduation because i thought people hated my guts. and i cant shake that feeling, i work in retail yet i get more and more dismissive and resentful as time passes. ive become cynical as fuck and its pushed away said old friend. i want to write fiction as a career and i draw occasionally, and im less and less motivated to do either of them because im always so angry and exhausted from work. im really insecure about my body on top of all that, i was pretty fat through middle school but i managed to burn it through high school and now im a twig. im not even tall enough to be skinny, i found out recently im 511 after years of assuming im at least 6 feet because of the shorter women i dated. and the dude my ex left me for is at least 62. i dont buy into redpill shit or anything but it was pretty crushing. ive kind of grown to...not idolize, but look to slasher films as inspiration to stay strong back when i was alone in school, like friday the 13th, so i could feel tough and project some kind of confidence. i fucking hate myself for having to look at fictional serial killers for self esteem. not to mention theyre mostly, if not all at least six feet tall.i dont even remember what the point of posting this was, im more depressed']\n",

      "['my mind lately. growing up, i was told that i wont be loved, that no one will ever love someone like me. in every sense of the word, i feel like a defect both on the inside and on the outside. objectively, i know that this is because of how i was brought up, but i am still chained down by these thoughts.i used to be severely depressed, harmed myself and had suicidal thoughts. i came a long way from that, alone. i pulled myself out of the well i was in and right now, im in a stable place in life. i feel excited going to college, i am good at making friends, i can function well now. im proud of myself for being something other than depressed.but i question my worth still. since the start of my self-recovery, i have met many people who have given me immense happiness, and their happiness is my happiness. yet have i given back to these people in equal parts what they have given me? can they do better without me, is their time better worth spent on someone else?am i properly showing these people how much i appreciate all that they do? am i being blind to the things they suffer from and keep hidden, just like how i do? i want to make sure that even if im not the person for them, i can make them happy with the time they have given to spend talking with me.i have mostly lived with my father and my grandmother for all my life. my grandmother has always taken care of me, and i love her but she is the primary source of all my struggles growing up, along with my mother. as a result, i am a terribly different person at home and elsewhere. because of this, i sometimes feel like a scam. i barely speak at home because of a period of selective mutism when i was young, and outside of home even though i am able to carry a good conversation, i am very conscious of the difficulties i sometimes have with speaking.because of all these issues, i think i will never be in a relationship. the idea of someone wanting to be with me exclusively is just ridiculous. i am aware that my self-esteem is horrible, but i am working on it. this is the next phase of growth i want to embark on. it is also the scariest.the world is a beautiful place, and i sincerely question whether or not it is okay for me to live in it. for now, i will make sure i live to every tomorrow, and find the answer to that question.thank you for reading. i have a fear of people finding out about my depression']\n",

we barely saw each other due to our busy schedules (only in weekends), we didnt spend quality time together, we got into little fights because we were stressed, she wasnt comfortable at my home because my dad also lived with us and it just wasnt a place that felt like home, she made new friends in the city she works in but could hardly see them due to travel times, we had trouble finding a place for ourselves, among other things.in march she already tried to break up with me when we got into a small fight. she was clearly upset. she said she didnt love me anymore, that she wants to feel love in different places, and that she wants to have a her/our own place. i begged her to stay and eventually she decided to stay.in april i showed her more love and things went pretty well. however, at the end of the month and especially in may things turned for the worse again. we got back into the drag and the love and intimacy faded again. about halfway may she apparently had enough and searched for her own place in the city she works in without telling me. two weeks later she had packed her stuff and told me she was leaving. again she told me she didnt love me anymore and that she wanted to leave. she just didnt believe in me anymore, that i could make her happy and she didnt want to commit to me. i helped her move the next day and managed to convince her to take a break. this only lasted 3 days because i stupidly called her up in an emotional state. she got angry and then really broke up with me.i was completely shocked both times when she wanted to break up with me. for me it came all out of nowhere. i managed to see her some days after the break up to talk about it. after having analyzed all that happened the past few months, i was convinced that it was just due to the stressful situation we were in. she told me that wasnt the case. she just said she doesnt love me anymore, that she doesnt believe i can make her happy, and that we do not fit in our core. i also told her that i made mistakes, but i was mostly putting the blame on the situation. we decided to stay friends. she still liked me and i suspect she still has feelings for me because she was very conflicted and emotional about breaking up with me. perhaps those are just high hopes though.ever since the break-up, i have been a complete wreck. i cried and raged for days. i didnt eat and couldnt sleep. i got a break from my internship. i failed two exams. i felt incredibly depressed and even suicidal. i just wanted to end it. occasionally, i felt motivated. i was desperately trying to look for ways to get her back. i contacted relationship experts and bought some of their products. i also talked to family and friends about it. surprisingly, i managed to get a place of my own. my situation didnt get better though. i did have contact with my ex, but progress was slow. after a month or so i got professional help because it was all getting out of hand. a psychologist diagnosed me so far with having an acute depression. a friend of mine also suggested me a book about narcissism as he himself is a narcissist and recognized a lot of the traits in me.fast forward to now and my situation has still not improved. i still long for my ex. i love her deeply and even consider her the love of my life. i feel extremely depressed and suicidal. i also dont feel like i am somebody as if im an empty shell. i dont know what to do with my life anymore, im not motivated at all and i have constant panic attacks because i fear losing my ex forever, never getting her back. i am getting professional help, but its a slow process. i was referred to a clinical psychologist who i had my intake with just yesterday. my next meeting is in two weeks.looking at myself and back at the last months of the relationship, i have the feeling that im mentally ill. i suspect that i either have a narcissistic personality disorder or a borderline personality disorder. its hard to say though as im no professional, but there is clearly something wrong in my head. i was completely oblivious to all the signals my girlfriend gave me. i was not empathetic and i was even mean to her, pushing her away. oddly enough, i love her deeply, more than anyone and anything, but for some reason i was not able to properly express that if i even did express it at all. i feel like there are two persons in my head: the one that feels, has dreams and ideas and wants to act on it vs. the one that is selfish, mean, negative and just keeps me from actually doing things. it feels like a constant battle in my head which is often own by the latter person.i suspect that many of my mental issues originate from my traumatic childhood. my parents divorced when i was 2, resulting in a long nast custody battle. i did not get to see my dad for 4 years because my mom had used me to get back at my dad by claiming he had sexually abused me which wasnt true. eventually, when i was 6 my mom died of cancer. i was never able to love my mom after knowing she used me and im actually glad she is dead. anyway, me and my two brothers then had to live with my dad, a man that was a stranger to me. money was tight, my dad became an alcoholic, and he was constantly fighting with my oldest brother. this went on for years. all my dads attention went towards my brothers and all he cared about with me were my school results. i got into a lot of trouble at school and with authorities in my youth. ever since i was 12 i have felt depressed, never able to feel really happy. i was suicidal and self-harming. at 18 i even tried to commit suicide, but luckily failed. all my life i have felt alone and unsupported until i met the girl who is now my ex. it was such a great relationship. we loved each other so much and things went almost perfect, rarely having a fight. i could not have imagined a better relationship. i was really happy with her. though sometimes i was still feeling down, unhappy or depressed']\n",

      "['my gf of almost 3 years broke up with me. we met online. she was 16 living in germany and i was 21 living in the netherlands. she initially invited me over to have fun, but we fell in love and decided for a long distance relationship (ldr). we had a near perfect ldr for 2,5 years. finally, in january this year she came to live with me. we were so happy. though things quickly turned bad. even though we were used to being together for long periods of time (2 month of constantly being together for example), it didnt work out the way we wanted. we both got full time jobs but with different time schedules. so we barely saw each other during the workweek. then in the weekends we failed to spend quality time together. she also didnt feel comfortable at home, because we lived with my dad. we were looking for our own place, but we had no luck. we didnt have big fights, just small fights that would increasingly frustrate us. due to my narcissistic behaviour, i pushed her away and took her for granted (i didnt recognize that at the time; didnt even realize i was a narcissist). she even gave me a second chance, but i failed to fix the issues since i didnt know what was wrong. besides all that, she is only 19 now and i was her first ever boyfriend. she had occasional thoughts of exploring and experimenting with other people, but she loved me so she wouldnt leave. though in the last few months in the relationship her love for me obviously faded and the single life became more attractive to her (also due to her new work/social environment). anyway, she broke up with me, saying she doesnt love me anymore; that she doesnt believe i can make her happy; that she cant commit to a lifelong relationship now; that she thinks we dont fit together in our core. i was shocked and heartbroken. i truly and deeply love her and i admit that i made a lot of mistakes in the last months of the relationship. i wish i could go back and do everything differently because i feel an enormous amount of guilt towards her. i also know that a lot of the mistakes i made come from my own emotional instability (e.g. narcissism). since the break up i have thought of her every day, i cried, i hurt myself, i even want to kill myself sometimes. i feel incredibly depressed']\n",

      "['my dad got into an argument with me after i was hesitant to phone a friend of mine and ask if his employer had any open spots. (topic of argument: whether or not it was begging rather than asking a favour when looking for a job) i cant exactly remember when something sparked in his mind, but he just flipped at me.ive lived a relatively comfortable, sheltered life, but there has been more and more pressure to spend less time playing around and more time working with my university studies, and work to find a part time job. for the past few months i have been tossing around a few applications (all rejection / no response) and until yesterday i hadnt dedicated much time to these (i do write my resumes to high standard, dont get me wrong).basically, when my dad flipped, he smacked his hands down on my desk (rattling some parts of my pc out of place so hard for perspective) and yelled about me about how sheltered i am and how much of a spoiled brat i was. to summarise what he told me there were two things that he said, one - \"you are so close to getting punched in the face right now, and its not child abuse any more its straight up assault\", and two - \"if you want to be treated like an adult then leave home, theres the world (points out window).\"note: my dad hasnt hit me in a while, but its happened before, and hes a controlling person with a short temper and little empathy. (did hit me once when he started shouting at me) he is known to lash out from time to time, unfortunately.the world i am being forced to live in now seems like it wont end, not the good ending where you retire, but just no light at the end of the tunnel. find a part time job, work hard at uni studies, get a better job, finish degree, get a better job from 9-5, pay off debts. which reminds me, im now being forced to pay part of my pay(possibly all) - should i get a part time job in the near-distant-future as rent. i dont know if its just my sheltered self talking here but it seems a bit much to have an 18 year old already paying rent for living at home, expect them to treat university as a full time job, get a part time job, take on lots of household chores, etc. etc.im 18, ive not been properly employed per se, but have had work experience for the best part of 6 years in the same role (paid). i havent seen a therapist nor have i confided in anyone or directly implied it, nor would i ever consider confiding, but i have more than a hunch i can relate to a lot of people in this subreddit...depression']\n",

id buy 20+ at a time. after awhile i recconnected with my friends and they were using drugs; xanax and oxycontin. i told my uncle about it and he wanted to buy oxycontin for him, he said if i did id be rewarded with money and more hours at work. during this time i was also financially supporting my father, i paid for everything except his car payment, insurance and phone bill -i bought the groceries paid gas electric and water... rent too. my uncle knew that i was in this situation and used it against me, my dad is his younger brother. so i did. going out and spending thousands on oxycontin, id go back to work expecting more work and hours and hed only hand me $20, sometimes hed give me $100 but no extra hours... hed get high and just laze around. eventually he pushed me into using oxycontin as well, saying he thought i was out to get him and that hed \"get rid of me\" if he felt too threatened so i did so he wouldnt see me as a threat. he said itd make me feel better, my ex girlfriend was stalking me and messing with my car, harrassing me everywhere i went. i became very dependent on it. after a couple months i couldnt go without kratom extract or oxy, my adderall prescription didnt even work on me anymore and my boss made me give him my prescription so he could trade it with other employees within the workplace for xanax and oxycontin. there were three occasions i almost lost my life because of this; the one that sticks out most in my mind is when i met a dealer in a walgreens parking lot and he handed me an empty taco bell bag- digging a knife hard into my side, i told him to take the $500 and just leave. when i left to tell my uncle what happened in tears he stared at me and said i was making it up to steal with him, that he couldnt stand the sight of me and that if i didnt have the money i stole from him by the next day at work he was going to fire me; and reminded me of how i was taking care of my father. he cut me off and i grew very sick, i couldnt sleep, sweating shaking and never eating. he drove me to a money tree and had me take out a payday loan to pay him back; then he blackmailed me into getting him pills again.being 19 i didnt know what else to do, my parents talked me out of college and i couldnt just leave my dad and work at a mcdonalds... we wouldve been homeless im sure... a dry spot over our town came around and the only dealer in town had fake presses with fentanyl in it -i warned uncle about how dangerous it was and he said he didnt care- forced the money into my hand and told me not to come back if i lost it, stole it or was going to be empty handed- to not even bother showing up to work if i didnt have anything for him. so i got it. we did that for three weeks straight, i was so sick i didnt care and he gave me back my regular hours -he had scaled my work week down to 20 hours a week. one day in his garage we were working and he clutches his chest and i say, \"whats wrong?\" and he goes, \"weve been doing heroin the past few weeks, ive done this before, ive felt this before. go and get narcan now\". i went and got narcan but he didnt need it at the end of the day... i was robbed dozens of times with the money he gave me and he held my job over my head and forced me to pay him back either going to money tree, or overdrafting bank accounts, cash advances from my credit cards, taking out loans... i was always just doing what i was told, i needed the job...i left after i was able to quit, i got very very sick for two weeks straight and was bedridden... i took out my final loan and relocated one hundred miles away to go to school. everything was going well until my roommate became addicted to methamphetamine and pawned off everything i owned... i was in need of work again so i started working with him again and soon after (i shouldve known...) he had me doing the same things all over again. i finally told my dad after two years of hiding it from everyone and he only talked to him... my uncle let him keep this car my dad was holding for him and he sold it for $3,000 and didnt think to give me a dime... didnt even think about all of the debt he had forced upon me... my dad told me to just \"forget about it, be a man. move on\". my uncle and i no longer talk anymore. my dad hasnt done anything except tell me im weak for letting it bother me. i tried to join the military but they sent me back home because of anxiety and depression (probably caused by this, i didnt tell them).but its so hard to move on... since ive been back ive had panic attacks regularly. i cant stop drinking myself to death and my depression']\n",
