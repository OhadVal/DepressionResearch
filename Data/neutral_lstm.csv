a8fbpr,how to purify your product,5.0,12.0,26.0,DMT,"extracting dmt of high purity is difficult when using an a b tek like cyb´s excellent salt tek however  extraction teks that produce a clean product more easily have much lower yield therefore  its advisable to do a modern a b tek and an additional purification step afterwards  this has the additional advantage that during the initial extraction  one does not have to take much care to extract a clean product  thous  its more easy to pull all the naphtha and reach a high yield   x200b   x200b   x200b to purify your product you have  two options   x200b   x200b normal re x dissolve product in nps  and carefully pull as much of the solvent up  as you can without pulling in any of the impurities  add some more  naphta and repeat to reduce the ammount of wasted dmt that will remain  with the impurities   x200b   x200b full a b purification dissolve product in vinegar essence  25    keep adding vinegar untill  the solution reaches a ph of 3  you will need quite a lot of vinegar  essence because the freebase will neutralize the acid filter through a funnel plugged with a cosmetic cotton pad  this will remove plant materials and fats from the solutionmake some 50ml of high concentrated lye base  add carefully until  the spice crashes out as freebase and the solution becomes milky  add  some salt  depending on the volume of your liquid  some 30g should be  enough for 500ml pull from this 5 times  during this the solution will go from milky to almost clear  freeze precipitate as usual   x200b   x200b pro cons of re x vs a b purification re x wont remove fats  and its difficult to get all the naphtha out  while getting none of the impurities in  the wastage is usually higher  and the purity lower compared to a b purification a b purification is a  lot of work however  its basically a full extraction on its own   without the waiting time for freezing lysing my suggestion is to go the extra mile and do the a b purification  you will be rewarded with a very pure product   x200b i came up with the a b purification tek myself  therefore no credit is given  but its really very easy and i am sure someone else had the same idea before  if you have qualified ideas how to improve the process  please write your suggestions into the comments   x200b edit  because it seems necessary you may prefer an extraction tek where purification is not needed  that is cool  its your decision  and i do not see a reason to change your mind please understand that  this post is not a ""my extraction is cooler then yours"" dick measurement contest  this post is needed advise how to purify an impure extract  there is a real need for it  because this question comes up a lot  without this post  i end up typing it out 3 times a day ",1265.0,214.0,0.61,2018-12-22 00:51:47,motorbit,0.0,0.0,5.0,2793.0,479.0,246,"__e _ex ext xtr tra rac act cti tin ing __d _dm dmt __o _of __h _hi hig igh __p _pu pur uri rit ity __i _is __d _di dif iff ffi fic icu cul ult __w _wh whe hen __u _us usi sin ing __a _an __a _a/ a/b __t _te tek __l _li lik ike __c _cy cyb yb´ b´s __e _ex exc xce cel ell lle len ent __s _sa sal alt __t _te tek ek. k.h .ho how owe wev eve ver er, __e _ex ext xtr tra rac act cti tio ion __t _te tek eks __t _th tha hat __p _pr pro rod odu duc uce __a __c _cl cle lea ean __p _pr pro rod odu duc uct __m _mo mor ore __e _ea eas asi sil ily __h _ha hav ave __m _mu muc uch __l _lo low owe wer __y _yi yie iel eld ld. d.t .th the her ere ref efo for ore re, __i _it its __a _ad adv dvi vis isa sab abl ble __t _to __d _do __a __m _mo mod ode der ern __a _a/ a/b __t _te tek __a _an and __a _an __a _ad add ddi dit iti tio ion ona nal __p _pu pur uri rif ifi fic ica cat ati tio ion __s _st ste tep __a _af aft fte ter erw rwa war ard rds ds. __t _th thi his __h _ha has __t _th the __a _ad add ddi dit iti tio ion ona nal __a _ad adv dva van ant nta tag age __t _th tha hat __d _du dur uri rin ing __t _th the __i _in ini nit iti tia ial __e _ex ext xtr tra rac act cti tio ion on, __o _on one __d _do doe oes __n _no not __h _ha hav ave __t _to __t _ta tak ake __m _mu muc uch __c _ca car are __t _to __e _ex ext xtr tra rac act __a __c _cl cle lea ean __p _pr pro rod odu duc uct ct. __t _th tho hou ous us, __i _it its __m _mo mor ore __e _ea eas asy __t _to __p _pu pul ull __a _al all __t _th the __n _na nap aph pht hth tha __a _an and __r _re rea eac ach __a __h _hi hig igh __y _yi yie iel eld ld. d.& .&# &#x #x2 x20 200 00b 0b;

 however i found it over 750k words written in my fantasy story  that i dont rely need naming stuff  hell  even by going the empire™ or the human empire™ i set up a temporary greater enemy for all ""good guys™""  but then  halfway through the story  as a by the way event  the empire was all but overthrown  all of its officials and men of power assassinated and then replaced by the joined effort of two paramilitary organisations who then assumed control of the region  and by the time my second arc commences  have led it to successful world domination in the second arc  i have evil corporations™ who i didnt name  this way  theres no one bad guy the heroes need to defeat  and can actually go about trying to live theur lives  yes  they do government sanctioned missions against said evil corporations  but its never clear to them who exactly they are fighting and for what reason  these things are just bigger than them  and rather than making some one thing a greater enemy

8zr8s8,thoughts on the final destination film series?,49.0,43.0,46.0,horror, i absolutely love the franchise  especially the original the original took itself very seriously  and the death scenes were pretty realistic and down to earth  the second one  and especially the 3rd started to pick up a more cartoony quality in regards to the special effects and gore  however  i would say that the first three films in the series are the only ones that actually managed to make me feel uncomfortable while watching and create paranoia after viewing them the fourth film was just awful  everything was very brightly colored  and sorta looked like a parody  the effects were insanely bad and cgi’d  the story poor and completely unmemorable the fifth film gets some props for returning to a somewhat serious tone  and while i’d like to give it a rewatch soon just to confirm  i remember thinking it was still somewhat forgettable simply because it failed to produce any sort of paranoia or “edge of your seat” intensity that the first three did  not to mention the shitty 3d effects combined with once again  bad cgi gore ,13630.0,5851.0,0.91,2018-07-18

hard later in life  creating a new language is even harder  creating one that sounds and looks believable and compelling is nye impossible  but i can still see half of fantasy worlds having an entire

8x8ahx,6 basic tips on how to be better at mut and a personal story,37.0,11.0,60.0,MaddenUltimateTeam,1  learn all of the defensive and offensive audibles to the point where you dont have to think of them while you are audibling  simply put  if you dont have the audibles memorized it will be hard to pick apart any defensive or stop any offense 2  user a yellow zone in coverage  being able to stop multiple routes on the field at once is huge  usering also generates turnovers  i find usering my mlb constantly is the best fit for me 3  stop going for it so much on 4th down  and know when to just take a field goal  dont get me wrong there are some situations where you should go for it  but 4th and 17 at your own 30 on the first drive of the game probably isnt one of those  in general  make wiser decisions on when to go for it 4  learn the difference between a 3 4 and a 4 3 and build your defense properly  too many times i see players plugging a guy like suggs into a 4 3 as an olb  this also applies to offense as well  know the formations and plays you like to use and get players that can do those jobs for you 5  lastly when building a team  remember its a videogame  it doesnt matter what name is on the card  it matters if he has good stats and traits  dont get me wrong if you really want your favorite player by all means get him and have fun  just know that there is a chance that he wont be as good as he was in real life 6  track how much you spend on the game  time and money  i have spent a lot of time and money on this game  and honestly i dont think it was worth it my personal story   not to get all mushy on a mut post  but if you constantly play madden or any videogame and its all you can think of  there is a chance you could have a videogame addiction  i realized this year that im addicted to videogames because they give me control of whats going on  as a child i really had no control over a lot of negative things in my life and i used madden  and other videogames  as an escape  if you feel like you are playing to much or spending to much money  please do yourself a favor and analyze why  most of the time there is an underlying cause you may have not realized ,465.0,1337.0,0.87,2018-07-08 21:49:36,tryhard360,0.0,0.0,14.0,2120.0,422.0,224,"__1 _1. __l _le lea ear arn __a _al all __o _of __t _th the __d _de def efe fen ens nsi siv ive __a _an and

9k1rnk,any good documentaries on george / asoiaf ?,4.0,2.0,43.0,freefolk,hi everyone i was wondering if anyone would happen to know if there are any good documentaries videos on george and his writing of  ice and fire   i feel like someone posted a video yesterday or the day before about its creation inspiration  but im already unable to find it  my favorite part of  got asoiaf  is the storytelling  particularly how the hell george creates a world and history on such an epic scope  gives us a multitude of characters and manages to make their plotlines converge and diverge in really interesting ways  complete with slow burn plots and twists that are more logical earned than probably any other series ive read  i started rereading  thrones  just yesterday and had forgotten how expert the pacing is  and how a thought or a look from a character can tell you as much about them as their murdering someone  ive been watching lots of interviews with him on youtube but theyre always such hodgepodges  is there any video out there that tries to cover the series and georges storytelling process a little more comprehensively  ,47023.0,2331.0,0.62,2018-09-30

4xome0,why gary johnson wants to abolish the department of education (xpost /r/garyjohnson),67.0,21.0,84.0,Libertarian,"people have understandable concerns about what would happen if we got rid of the department of education  but lets tackle those concerns one of the first things concerns that people have is that without the doe  schools would teach religion rather than science   except that that is already happening in conservative fundamentalist places  http   www slate com articles health and science science 2014 01 creationism in texas public schools undermining the charter movement html  with the current system  and if the department of education was defunded  it still would not allow creationism to be taught in school  as the  ""supreme court ruled in edwards v  aguillard that teaching creationism is unconstitutional "" as well as  ""in the 2005 kitzmiller v  dover case  judge john jones iii ruled in federal district court that intelligent design is still creationism and equally unconstitutional ""even now  the department of education does not  "" develop curricula  determine state education standards  or develop or implement testing to measure whether states are meeting their education standards  http   www2 ed gov about overview focus what pg4 html doesnot  "" regardless of your opinion of it   the doe is not what created common core standards  that was brought about by  ""private nonprofit groups and state education departments ""  http   www politifact com wisconsin statements 2014 jul 25 joe leibham federal government required states adopt common co  effectively the roles of the doe basically boil down to  financial aid  data collection  identifying problems  and prohibiting discrimination   http   www2 ed gov about overview focus what pg3 html howdoes   the argument that gary johnson has is that these duties can be done more effectively on a state level  states would be able to do all of these duties with a better understanding of the schooling in their state and their independent issues  and if you were concerned about conservative states adhering to discriminatory practices in funding of schools  johnson wants to  implement a school voucher program similar to the one he created when he was governor of new mexico   http   www educationworld com a news how libertarian looks education where gary johnson stands 226926093  this allows families to choose to go to whichever school they wanted  public or private  it also helps poorer  brings competition into k 12 education similar to that in universities  where the schools have to compete to get students to add on to that point  as   u chipitin states  the voucher system also helps poor schools compete with wealthier ones  as  ""schools are funded by property taxes so people tend to think about poor students moving to better schools in wealthy areas  if you create a voucher program you equalize the revenue per students of schools   poor schools will have higher revenue to higher better teachers and more programs ""the other issue that gary johnson has with the department of education  is that federal funding for schools goes through the doe  which takes its share of money  and then goes to the schools  with the abolition of the doe  schools will have more funding to be able to operate better  in the voucher article  he states  ""look  just leave the states alone  what people don’t realize is by leaving the states alone  the states will actually have more money ""the basis is not to deregulate education  it is that the roles department of education should be left to the states  and that doing so would be cheaper  and more effective for their students ",31385.0,1679.0,0.95,2016-08-14 18:47:12,calmdownpaco,0.0,0.0,12.0,3555.0,494.0,256,"__p _pe peo eop opl

724cwc,"[ethics][discussion] as neogaf clamors for palmer luckey ""to leave the industry"", i once again ask: of what value is ""freedom of speech"", when people can get fired for their political views?",274.0,81.0,190.0,KotakuInAction,"hello i started a similar discussion a couple months ago  in the light of this thread   http   archive is woyjs   id like to ask again  because its seemingly getting worse most  all   of us would agree that freedom of speech is important  however  the reality shows that you dont have much freedom unless you accept severe consequences  many industries are lead by ""progressives"" that accept noone of conservative leanings  other big companies will fire their employees if those happen to post something on social media that the company feels hurts its image  thus removing the freedom of speech for all practical purposes now  people on neogaf want palmer luckey to leave the industry  read the above linked thread  its full of such comments and gross insults   because he supports the right  i havent heard him being get caught by the police  so i assume he isnt doing anything illegal  thus its all about individual moral leanings  to which i  someone who considers himself left libertarian and really progressive  acceptable  i dont want to live in a society where people with differeing political views are literally pushed towards ruin  i also dont want to play feminist bedridden power fantasies in all games i also can make a distinction between palmer luckey  the dumb white supremacist  and palmer luckey  the intelligent genius that keeps progressing virtual reality technology  just like i can differentiate between roman polansik  the child rapist  and roman polanski  the great film maker  or michael jackson  the supposedly child molester  and michael jackson  the legendary musician  again  let me ask  what good is ""freedom of speech""  when people are driven out of entire industry branches only because of their private political leanings  and do you see it getting better  if so  where  when  with each passing day  i hate this world more that keeps going from one ignorant extreme to another  why is it so hard to accept that extremes are never that great  how about compromise  shades of grey  im now waiting for ubisoft to remove the recent kanye west blackface joke  and it makes me vomit  not the joke  the

6k7g5w,"[opinion] neogaf is a meet-up point for child porn, belittles discrimination against men, anita sarkeesian calls others ""garbage human"", etc. - time for the press change their narrative of ""evil gamergate""?",191.0,36.0,206.0,KotakuInAction,"the irrational hate against gamergate was always idiotic  make no mistake  anybody who actually informed himself and or spent time in places like kia knew that gg is not a harassment campaign or a misogynistic movement  gamergate is about video games being fun  censorshop sucks  and facts over feelings  however  that´s not what the mass media portrayed gg as  there  gg is the root of all evil  the target of all and any insults whenever some idiots harass somebody or when social justice activists decide that cristicism against a certain opinion equals harassment  with the recent hyper influx of mis steps from the side of social justice activists  however  i think it is at long last time for the mass media  the press  anybody who´s covering this mess  to change their view on gg  more importantly  it is time they start reporting on the malicious shit that social justice activists keep committing today  we have a former neogaf mod being outed as an offending pedophile who consumed child porn  this is the second neogaf mod of that ""type""  a community that heralds itself as a bastion of justice  progressivism and social fairness  just days ago  the same website defended the discrimination against men  when a spanish video game event would only allow women to enter the public event  neogaf kept ridiculing anyone who called this discrimination  going as far as saying ""sexism against men doesn´t exist because men haven´t undergone centuries of discrimination and abuse"" then another couple days  anita sarkeesian  a person making money and fame by releasing badly researched video  condemning video games in a shallow manner  unprovokedly called youtuber sargon of akkard a ""garbage human"" and started a harassment campaign against him on twitter  additional examples are ample                                                     so here i am  asking why the mass media are not picking this up  let me be clear  anybody who actually harasses women  is racist or does whatever heinous stuff  deserves to be called out  however  the same goes for overzealous social justice activists  too  discrimination is never okay  no matter against whom it is set  child porn distribution isn´t ok  either  harassing ""the other side""  because you deem yourself the ""good side""  is also not okay  but the media needs to report on this  too  sorry if this comes off as an annoying rant  but it´s really hard to keep watching the continued shiting on gamergate  while hateful members and hateful actions of the so called social justice activists go unreported ",4741.0,7480.0,0.91,2017-06-29 13:24:41,bickid,0.0,0.0,31.0,2578.0,409.0,264,"__t _th the __i _ir irr rra rat ati tio ion ona nal __h _ha hat ate __a _ag

879f4k,now i'm 100% sure vision won't die in infinity war,1.0,15.0,50.0,marvelstudios,"hi guys  ive been lurking on this subreddit for a couple of months and i want to share a theor of mine  if you could call it a theory  its more of an observation  about visions fate in iw like many people online i was inclined to believe that he wont survive in iw  but now with the new released footage i doubt that this will be the case  let me explain vision was created with the help of the mind stone  so it was enstablished from the very start that somehow when thanos arrives hell be in danger  hes not a main character  people dont care that much about him as they care about other characters as cap or tony  why do they insist on the ""omg vision will die   "" story in the trailers and the tv spots  we already knew thanos   co  will be after him  there is nothing we didnt already know  why use footage with him being attacked by the back order and the one when hes telling wanda theyre out of time if hes been already half dead since ultron put the mind stone in his head  i watched the trailer reactions on youtube and everybody is like ""meh this is what i expected""  theres no emotional response except from those who really like him  i noticed that most people are indifferent or dislike him  dunno why   what if theyre pushing this to mask something bigger  i think he wil play an important role in the movie  dont ask me what role cause i dont know  but i find it suspicious that they put those scenes in the trailers  if a character will die why would you spoil it oh  and another reason i think its safe  they also showed us that he and want are finally in a relationship  killing him will result in wanda going mad and not being able to control her powers  which will be basically age of ultron v2 0  she was devastated when pietro died and i dont see the point in doing the same thing again  killing someone she loves  it would mean 0 character development for her  and it will be disappointing to find out that the villain is destroyed by a furious wanda who is grieving a character most people dont care too much about  not to say itd be bad writing 101 tldr i think the footage with vision being tortured being in pain from the trailers is just a distraction to make us not to think too much about him just to hide his possible big role in the events of the movie ",200.0,1343.0,0.59,2018-03-26 16:15:50,antricotul,0.0,0.0,10.0,2312.0,438.0,237,"__h _hi __g _gu guy uys ys, __i _iv ive __b _be bee een __l _lu lur urk rki kin ing __o _on __t _th thi his __s _su sub ubr bre red edd ddi dit __f _fo for __a __c _co cou oup upl ple __o _of __m _mo mon ont nth ths __a _an and __i __w _wa wan ant __t _to __s _sh sha har are __a __t _th the heo eor __o _of __m _mi min ine __( _(i (if __y _yo you __c _co cou oul uld __c _ca cal all __i _it __a __t _th the heo eor ory ry, __i _it its __m _mo mor ore __o _of __a _an __o _ob obs bse ser erv rva vat ati tio ion on) __a _ab abo bou out __v _vi vis isi sio ion ons __f _fa fat ate __i _in __i _iw iw. w.l .li lik ike __m _ma man any __p _pe peo eop opl ple __o _on onl nli lin ine __i __w _wa was __i _in inc ncl cli lin ine ned __t _to __b _be bel eli lie iev eve __t _th tha hat __h _he __w _wo won ont __s _su sur urv rvi viv ive __i _in __i _iw iw. __b _bu but __n _no now __w _wi wit ith __t _th the __n _ne new __r _re rel ele lea eas ase sed __f _fo foo oot ota tag age __i __d _do dou oub ubt __t _th tha hat __t _th thi his __w _wi wil ill __b _be __t _th the __c _ca cas ase se. __l _le let __m _me __e _ex exp xpl pla lai ain in. n.v .vi vis isi sio ion __w _wa was __c _cr cre rea eat ate ted __w _wi wit ith __t _th the __h _he hel elp __o _of __t _th the __m _mi min ind __s _st sto ton one ne, __s _so __i _it __w _wa was __e _en ens nst sta tab abl bli lis ish she hed __f _fr fro rom __t _th the __v _ve ver ery __s _st sta tar art __t _th tha hat __s _so som ome meh eho how __w _wh whe hen __t _th tha han ano nos __a _ar arr rri riv ive ves __h _he hel ell __b _be __i _in __d _da dan ang nge ger er. __h _he hes __n _no not __a __m _ma mai ain __c _ch cha har ara rac act cte ter er, __p _pe peo eop opl ple __d _do don ont __c _ca car are __t _th tha hat __m _mu muc uch __a _ab abo bou out __h _hi him __a _as __t _th the hey __c _ca car are __a _ab abo bou out __o _ot oth the her __c _ch cha har ara rac act cte ter ers __a _as __c _ca cap __o _or __t _to ton ony ny. __w _wh why __d _do __t _th the hey __i _in ins nsi sis ist __o _on __t _th the __"" _""o ""om omg __v _vi vis isi sio ion __w _wi wil ill __d _di die ie! e!! !!! !!"" __s _st sto tor ory __i _in __t _th the __t _tr tra rai ail ile ler ers __a _an and __t _th the __t _tv __s _sp spo pot ots ts?

1ayoxu,libertarian system with no inheritance,0.0,63.0,38.0,Libertarian,since ive started putting time in this site  my libertarian stance ive held for quite a time has constantly been challenged  i love that  and ive come to recognize a lot of problems with the traditional just free market  minimal government system well  mainly just one big one  in a free market system  money shifts towards a certain group and then stays within that group and stagnates  this essentially means less money for everyone else and a stationary economy  as well as the ethical problem of some people not really having to work for their money while others do  why couldnt we just  whenever someone dies  claim and redistribute all his assets to the public  all his possessions  including any businesses he has  are claimed by the government and sold to the highest bidder  and all monetary assets are evenly spread throughout the public  that way  everyone who got where they did seriously did start on the same playing field everyone else did  or at least more than they do now  no advantages  you really do get out what you put in  simple  incentives production  less people expecting too much too little out of an overly convoluted system  less people cynical of the american dream  sounds great to me of course there are loop holes around enforcing this  but we already tax inheritance  were already clearly thinking in that direction and i think we should take that all the way to its logical conclusion  at the very least  its something to think about  what do you think ,26823.0,608.0,0.55,2013-03-25 09:58:50,brokilodeluxe,0.0,0.0,5.0,1497.0,253.0,175,"__s _si sin inc nce __i _iv ive __s _st sta tar art rte ted __p _pu put utt tti tin ing __t _ti tim ime __i _in __t _th thi his __s _si sit ite te, __m _my __l _li lib ibe ber ert rta tar ari ria ian __s _st sta tan anc nce __i _iv ive __h _he hel eld __f _fo for __q _qu qui uit ite __a __t _ti tim ime __h _ha has __c _co con ons nst sta tan ant ntl tly __b _be bee een __c _ch cha hal all lle len eng nge ged ed. __i __l _lo lov ove __t _th tha hat at, __a _an and __i _iv ive __c _co com ome __t _to __r _re rec eco cog ogn gni niz ize __a __l _lo lot __o _of __p _pr pro rob obl ble lem ems __w _wi wit ith __t _th the __t _tr tra rad adi dit iti tio ion ona nal __j _ju jus ust st- t-f -fr fre ree ee- e-m -ma mar ark rke ket et, __m _mi min ini nim ima mal __g _go gov ove ver ern rnm nme men ent __s _sy sys yst ste tem em. m.w .we wel ell ll, __m _ma mai ain inl nly __j _ju jus ust __o _on one __b _bi big __o _on one ne. __i _in __a __f _fr fre ree __m _ma mar ark rke ket __s _sy sys yst ste tem em, __m _mo mon one ney __s _sh shi hif ift fts __t _to tow owa war ard rds __a __c _ce cer ert rta tai ain __g _gr gro rou oup __a _an and __t _th the hen __s _st sta tay ays __w _wi wit ith thi hin __t _th tha hat __g _gr gro rou oup __a _an and __s _st sta tag agn gna nat ate tes es. __t _th thi his __e _es ess sse sen ent nti tia ial all lly __m _me mea ean ans __l _le les ess __m _mo mon one ney __f _fo for __e _ev eve ver ery ryo yon one __e _el els lse __a _an and __a __s _st sta tat ati tio ion ona nar ary __e _ec eco con ono nom omy my, __a _as __w _we wel ell __a _as __t _th the __e _et eth thi hic ica cal __p _pr pro rob obl ble lem __o _of __s _so som ome __p _pe peo eop opl ple __n _no not __r _re rea eal all lly __h _ha hav avi vin ing __t _to __w _wo wor ork __f _fo for __t _th the hei eir __m _mo mon one ney __w _wh whi hil ile __o _ot oth the her ers __d _do do. __w _wh why __c _co cou oul uld ldn dnt __w _we __j _ju jus ust st, __w _wh whe hen ene nev eve ver __s _so som ome meo eon one __d _di die ies es, __c _cl cla lai aim __a _an and __r _re red edi dis ist str tri rib ibu but ute __a _al all __h _hi his __a _as ass sse set ets __t _to __t _th the __p _pu pub ubl bli lic ic?

9zwpzz,i realized i worry about my horse way too much.,1.0,8.0,47.0,reddeadredemption,the horse bonding system is so creative i feel like my horse is my second dog because im always worried about her  during a firefight  im worried that shell get hit the while time even though that never happens  when i have to get odd my horse im constantly worried she wont find her way back to me  especially during cut scenes when my horse isnt visible  im worried someone will steal my horse while shes hitched outside of a building i need to go into    realizing this never ever will happen  halfway through the game and with plenty of money  im still using my slow ass horse because i cant stand the thought of upgrading and losing her to a faster stallion  i dont even care that shes slow as shit  mim constantly worried about how tired  emotional and hungry she is    i check on her health and energy stats more than mine i constantly pat her and feed her more than she needs  i jump off my horse all the time so i could brush her way more than i need to  i stopped in the middle of a mission in saint dennis to ride all the way across the other side of the city to find a general store once i realized i was out of things to feed my horse  my horse had 100  energy and health  including the core but i still went anyways because i hated the thought of not being able to feed her  caring for my horse has become the most important thing to me in rdr2 after the missions themselves  ,517.0,1610.0,0.66,2018-11-24 09:53:34,sammyaxelrod,0.0,0.0,10.0,1423.0,270.0,152,"__t _th the __h _ho hor ors

youd want to make an entire new language for your world  but since theres many  many resons for worldbuilding  i dont much care either if you do  that being said learning a language is hard  extremely hard later in life  creating a new language is even harder  creating one that sounds and looks believable and compelling is nye impossible  but i can still see half of fantasy worlds having an entire new language made for them  which again  isnt a bad thing what bothers me is the sheer lack of effort put into conlangs  and on the other end  the overboard focus on just the language and nothing else ""but tolkien did it""tolkien was a linguist  his entire life goal was to study and create languages  and the result of that lifelong devotion is the elven language  which cannot convey most of the

8x8ahx,6 basic tips on how to be better at mut and a personal story,37.0,11.0,60.0,MaddenUltimateTeam,1  learn all of the defensive and offensive audibles to the point where you dont have to think of them while you are audibling  simply put  if you dont have the audibles memorized it will be hard to pick apart any defensive or stop any offense 2  user a yellow zone in coverage  being able to stop multiple routes on the field at once is huge  usering also generates turnovers  i find usering my mlb constantly is the best fit for me 3  stop going for it so much on 4th down  and know when to just take a field goal  dont get me wrong there are some situations where you should go for it  but 4th and 17 at your own 30 on the first drive of the game probably isnt one of those  in general  make wiser decisions on when to go for it 4  learn the difference between a 3 4 and a 4 3 and build your defense properly  too many times i see players plugging a guy like suggs into a 4 3 as an olb  this also applies to offense as well  know the formations and plays you like to use and get players that can do those jobs for you 5  lastly when building a team  remember its a videogame  it doesnt matter what name is on the card  it matters if he has good stats and traits  dont get me wrong if you really want your favorite player by all means get him and have fun  just know that there is a chance that he wont be as good as he was in real life 6  track how much you spend on the game  time and money  i have spent a lot of time and money on this game  and honestly i dont think it was worth it my personal story   not to get all mushy on a mut post  but if you constantly play madden or any videogame and its all you can think of  there is a chance you could have a videogame addiction  i realized this year that im addicted to videogames because they give me control of whats going on  as a child i really had no control over a lot of negative things in my life and i used madden  and other videogames  as an escape  if you feel like you are playing to much or spending to much money  please do yourself a favor and analyze why  most of the time there is an underlying cause you may have not realized ,465.0,1337.0,0.87,2018-07-08 21:49:36,tryhard360,0.0,0.0,14.0,2120.0,422.0,224,"__1 _1. __l _le lea ear arn __a _al all __o _of __t _th the __d _de def efe fen ens nsi siv ive __a _an and

8nd6ll,"what is the history of radium being used, and eventually discredited, as a treatment for hearing problems?",2.0,0.0,106.0,AskHistorians,sorry if my question isn’t particularly eloquently phrased  i really don’t know much about this at all or what kind of information is out there about it  my grandmother died of thyroid cancer a few years before i was born and i’ve heard that it was believed her cancer was due to her exposure to radium via rods being stuck up her nose       when she was a young girl  1930s  as a treatment for hearing problems  i am not a scientist or physician by any stretch of the imagination and hindsight is certainly 20 20 but this just seems like such an outrageous treatment to me  i’m just hoping i can learn some more information on how this came to be  how popular widespread the treatment was  and how it was eventually ended as a viable treatment  or find out that this is probably more of a family myth than fact if it turns out there isn’t much evidence this is something that happened   thanks in advance for any info ,1745.0,3114.0,0.67,2018-05-31 02:11:56,ghostmutt8,0.0,0.0,17.0,919.0,169.0,114,"__s _so sor orr rry __i _if __m _my __q _qu que ues est sti tio ion __i _is isn sn’ n’t __p _pa par art rti tic icu cul ula lar arl rly __e _el elo loq oqu que uen ent ntl tly __p _ph phr hra ras ase sed ed, __i __r _re rea eal all lly __d _do don on’ n’t __k _kn kno now __m _mu muc uch __a _ab abo bou out __t _th thi his __a _at __a _al all __o _or __w _wh wha hat __k _ki kin ind __o _of __i _in inf nfo for orm rma mat ati tio ion __i _is __o _ou out __t _th the her ere __a _ab abo bou out __i _it it. __m _my __g _gr gra ran and ndm dmo mot oth the her __d _di die ied __o _of __t _th thy hyr yro roi oid __c _ca can anc nce cer __a __f _fe few __y _ye yea ear ars __b _be bef efo for ore __i __w _wa was __b _bo bor orn __a _an and __i _i’ i’v ’ve __h _he hea ear ard __t _th tha hat __i _it __w _wa was __b _be bel eli lie iev eve ved __h _he her __c _ca can anc nce cer __w _wa was __d _du due __t _to __h _he her __e _ex exp xpo pos osu sur ure __t _to __r _ra rad adi diu ium __v _vi via __r _ro rod ods __b _be bei ein ing __s _st stu tuc uck __u _up __h _he her __n _no nos ose __( _(?

4xome0,why gary johnson wants to abolish the department of education (xpost /r/garyjohnson),67.0,21.0,84.0,Libertarian,"people have understandable concerns about what would happen if we got rid of the department of education  but lets tackle those concerns one of the first things concerns that people have is that without the doe  schools would teach religion rather than science   except that that is already happening in conservative fundamentalist places  http   www slate com articles health and science science 2014 01 creationism in texas public schools undermining the charter movement html  with the current system  and if the department of education was defunded  it still would not allow creationism to be taught in school  as the  ""supreme court ruled in edwards v  aguillard that teaching creationism is unconstitutional "" as well as  ""in the 2005 kitzmiller v  dover case  judge john jones iii ruled in federal district court that intelligent design is still creationism and equally unconstitutional ""even now  the department of education does not  "" develop curricula  determine state education standards  or develop or implement testing to measure whether states are meeting their education standards  http   www2 ed gov about overview focus what pg4 html doesnot  "" regardless of your opinion of it   the doe is not what created common core standards  that was brought about by  ""private nonprofit groups and state education departments ""  http   www politifact com wisconsin statements 2014 jul 25 joe leibham federal government required states adopt common co  effectively the roles of the doe basically boil down to  financial aid  data collection  identifying problems  and prohibiting discrimination   http   www2 ed gov about overview focus what pg3 html howdoes   the argument that gary johnson has is that these duties can be done more effectively on a state level  states would be able to do all of these duties with a better understanding of the schooling in their state and their independent issues  and if you were concerned about conservative states adhering to discriminatory practices in funding of schools  johnson wants to  implement a school voucher program similar to the one he created when he was governor of new mexico   http   www educationworld com a news how libertarian looks education where gary johnson stands 226926093  this allows families to choose to go to whichever school they wanted  public or private  it also helps poorer  brings competition into k 12 education similar to that in universities  where the schools have to compete to get students to add on to that point  as   u chipitin states  the voucher system also helps poor schools compete with wealthier ones  as  ""schools are funded by property taxes so people tend to think about poor students moving to better schools in wealthy areas  if you create a voucher program you equalize the revenue per students of schools   poor schools will have higher revenue to higher better teachers and more programs ""the other issue that gary johnson has with the department of education  is that federal funding for schools goes through the doe  which takes its share of money  and then goes to the schools  with the abolition of the doe  schools will have more funding to be able to operate better  in the voucher article  he states  ""look  just leave the states alone  what people don’t realize is by leaving the states alone  the states will actually have more money ""the basis is not to deregulate education  it is that the roles department of education should be left to the states  and that doing so would be cheaper  and more effective for their students ",31385.0,1679.0,0.95,2016-08-14 18:47:12,calmdownpaco,0.0,0.0,12.0,3555.0,494.0,256,"__p _pe peo eop opl

7gjggz,need for a communal conspiracy evidence megadocument,15.0,1.0,52.0,conspiracy,"time and time again  i find myself coming to this subreddit  asking for substantial evidence about modern conspiracies  things that i have read about in places like this for years  but never have actually compiled concrete evidence to support  and thus i come to arguments with my institutionalized friends  and i say something like ""well the rostchilds own all but 3 national banks""  and then my friends contest    and to which i have nothing to prove my point  typical search engines just reveal things like this  ""both were created and funded by the rothschild family  today the federal reserve bank is still owned and controlled by the rothschild family and you and i are forced to pay taxes to them every time we get a paycheck from our employers  this is the federal tax on our paystub ""this proves absolutely nothing  its completely up to who you choose to believe  there is absolutely no evidence for a typical search engine user to prove statements like ""the rostchilds own every national bank""  one of the best things about large information dumps like the dnc wikileaks was that you could claim something  like how so and so said such and such  and then you could literally show your speculative friend the exact instance or email that proves this logic  in my opinion  compiling an open sourced  conclusive document that displays actual evidence for vital conspiracies that the community believes in is crucial to ever achieving justice and public trust for the real conspiracies we believe in that end up being true  this document should be as unbiased as possible  and should list all evidence for any conspiracy  as well as the 1  reasoning why someone would desire to cover up such a situation  resulting in the current conspiracy theory 2  reasoning why such a theory might be absurd or unrealisticthis document would contribute the thoughts and efforts of the hundreds of people who believe in different theories  instead of these peoples efforts going to waste  from now on  i could simply make my way to this document and literally show my friends the evidence for why people believe the rostchilds own all world banking  instead of me just making claims about how i have read stuff that random people on the internet have claimed before on random reddit threads  i am genuinely curious if any other people have experienced this type of situation  and if they would be in support of such a document  i wholeheartedly believe it could be crucial in helping to solve and vindictive some of the huge crimes and conspiracies that we all believe in  whether it be something as believable as ""9 11 was performed by the us government""  or things as unbelievable as ""the earth is flat""  i think it would be insanely beneficial to all people for such a document to exist  highlighting the reasoning and evidence behind any such conspiracy  i know we already have the ""conspiracy megapost"" for confirmed conspiracies  but this would obviously be for conspiracies that are technically unconfirmed  ",1040.0,229.0,0.76,2017-11-30

65728m,[game tales] what is the story from your games?,7.0,8.0,47.0,DnD,so  a thought occurred to me after last nights session  there is  one  important story to the game were playing  one thing that will become myth  the legends of this game that we will keep telling years from now  theres one facet to this campaign that already dominates our conversations about d d  and it only seems to get more epic with each passing session for us  that story is the rogue and his new sword   our campaign began with two players trying to stop the villain from getting his hands on three macguffins  a sword  a book  and an idol  im pretty sure he had the idol before the game began  and he got the book in the first session while the rogue was scoping out the place where the sword was kept   and then i joined the game as a paladin with a dark past  which  it sounds like  gave the dm the motivation to make the sword a longsword of vengeance  eventually  we escaped with the sword  but  though i held onto it  i never tried to wield it   the night after we got back to town with the sword  the villain managed to sneak in while we were asleep  and i woke up just as he was grabbing the sword  i compelled him to drop it and shouted for everyone to wake up  the rogue dashed in  grabbed the sword  and swung at the villain  upon drawing blood  he became cursed  compelled to use only the sword  and to fly into a rage if he is wounded in a fight   its also a longsword  so  he cant get sneak attack with it     but it gets better  our party is all high charisma and average or below wisdom  the rogue keeps lying his ass off about why hes using the cursed sword that hes not very good with  and we go along with it  even though we both know  the warlock because of good arcana checks  and me because of divine sense  how cursed the sword is   we even wound up helping defend his terrible decision last session   we were accompanied on our trip to face down the bbeg by one of the nobles from whom we stole the sword  he  of course  recognized the family sword and asked a  why we had it and b  why we thought bringing it to face the villain who needed it for his ritual was a good idea  i cant remember the answers the rogue gave  but we presented a unified front  this terrible decision makes perfect sense so  whats  the  story from your games  can you tell yet what element of your current

4xome0,why gary johnson wants to abolish the department of education (xpost /r/garyjohnson),67.0,21.0,84.0,Libertarian,"people have understandable concerns about what would happen if we got rid of the department of education  but lets tackle those concerns one of the first things concerns that people have is that without the doe  schools would teach religion rather than science   except that that is already happening in conservative fundamentalist places  http   www slate com articles health and science science 2014 01 creationism in texas public schools undermining the charter movement html  with the current system  and if the department of education was defunded  it still would not allow creationism to be taught in school  as the  ""supreme court ruled in edwards v  aguillard that teaching creationism is unconstitutional "" as well as  ""in the 2005 kitzmiller v  dover case  judge john jones iii ruled in federal district court that intelligent design is still creationism and equally unconstitutional ""even now  the department of education does not  "" develop curricula  determine state education standards  or develop or implement testing to measure whether states are meeting their education standards  http   www2 ed gov about overview focus what pg4 html doesnot  "" regardless of your opinion of it   the doe is not what created common core standards  that was brought about by  ""private nonprofit groups and state education departments ""  http   www politifact com wisconsin statements 2014 jul 25 joe leibham federal government required states adopt common co  effectively the roles of the doe basically boil down to  financial aid  data collection  identifying problems  and prohibiting discrimination   http   www2 ed gov about overview focus what pg3 html howdoes   the argument that gary johnson has is that these duties can be done more effectively on a state level  states would be able to do all of these duties with a better understanding of the schooling in their state and their independent issues  and if you were concerned about conservative states adhering to discriminatory practices in funding of schools  johnson wants to  implement a school voucher program similar to the one he created when he was governor of new mexico   http   www educationworld com a news how libertarian looks education where gary johnson stands 226926093  this allows families to choose to go to whichever school they wanted  public or private  it also helps poorer  brings competition into k 12 education similar to that in universities  where the schools have to compete to get students to add on to that point  as   u chipitin states  the voucher system also helps poor schools compete with wealthier ones  as  ""schools are funded by property taxes so people tend to think about poor students moving to better schools in wealthy areas  if you create a voucher program you equalize the revenue per students of schools   poor schools will have higher revenue to higher better teachers and more programs ""the other issue that gary johnson has with the department of education  is that federal funding for schools goes through the doe  which takes its share of money  and then goes to the schools  with the abolition of the doe  schools will have more funding to be able to operate better  in the voucher article  he states  ""look  just leave the states alone  what people don’t realize is by leaving the states alone  the states will actually have more money ""the basis is not to deregulate education  it is that the roles department of education should be left to the states  and that doing so would be cheaper  and more effective for their students ",31385.0,1679.0,0.95,2016-08-14 18:47:12,calmdownpaco,0.0,0.0,12.0,3555.0,494.0,256,"__p _pe peo eop opl

8msjdy,remme - a real game changer!,0.0,4.0,28.0,CryptoCurrency,honestly  if you havent heard of remme check it out  ico took place in february 2018 and raised 20m usd within two days of the start of the token sale   i witnessed it  trust me   the chat was insane   the whole idea   passwordless entry to databases and business software with sensitive information  the protocol essentially links a device to an ssl certificate   links the ssl certificate to the blockchain so that users can then login with remme at the click of a single button  remme masternodes  a masternode will essentially authenticate logins and deal with the approval of certificates  users who run a masternode will receive 90  of the revenue generated from certificates  certificates cost  1 and need to be renewed annually  so lets do the numbers  remme plan the following q3 2018   launch of masternodes  requirements   250k tokens and an entry grade pc  at first there will only be 300 masternodes  based on a first come first served basis  with presale participants receiving priority  pilot programme  changelly   cryptocurrency exchange partnered with binance   over 500k users  mercury cash   unsurewandx   unsure unnamed fintech firm   500m users unnamed telecom company 640m users in total thats over 1b users  not sure how many certificates these businesses would need  however lets assume 10  do  thats 100m certificates  therefore  100m   0 9    90m split between 300 masternodes    300k revenue per node  per year  obviously  300 masternodes are only temporary and the number will increase over time  therefore  as the number of nodes increase the revenue per node may begin to decrease  it all depends on the speed of adoption and the user base behind remme  this coin has the potential to be huge  the team were in attendance at consensus 2018 and showed off the demo of their product  set to launch in q3 you wont want to miss this ,372.0,1219.0,0.5,2018-05-28 22:09:16,Wicked243,0.0,0.0,6.0,1901.0,318.0,205,"__h _ho hon one nes est stl tly ly, __i _if __y _yo you __h _ha hav ave ven ent __h _he hea ear ard __o _of __r _re rem emm mme __c _ch che hec eck __i _it __o _ou out ut. __i _ic ico __t _to too ook __p _pl pla lac ace __i _in __f _fe feb ebr bru rua uar ary __2 _20 201 018 __a _an and __r _ra rai ais ise sed __2 _20 20m __u _us usd __w _wi wit ith thi hin __t _tw two __d _da day ays __o _of __t _th the __s _st sta tar art __o _of __t _th the __t _to tok oke ken __s _sa sal ale le. __( _(i __w _wi wit itn tne nes ess sse sed __i _it it, __t _tr tru rus ust __m _me __- __t _th the __c _ch cha hat __w _wa was __i _in ins nsa san ane ne!

79q97e,where should i travel to?,5.0,20.0,25.0,travel,"hi there  i would like to go solo traveling for a few months but i have no idea where i should go  as i basically like any country that i stumble upon  so i was wondering if any of you could give me any advice  given my interests  past travels  etc  any help would be appreciated   sorry if this question has been asked many times   i tried to use the search function  but couldnt find a topic that could really help me  so i thought id just make my own   country of origin  the netherlandscountry preferences    i have been to  thailand  birma  australia  road trip through many many parts of australia  though its obviously such a big country that theres still loads to explore   usa  michigan   costa rica  spain  greece  france  czech republic  germany  belgium  sweden  denmark  turkey  i would prefer not to travel to the last 10 again  and i think for now i have my mind set on going to a country i have  never  been before  but i also know that the us  thailand  birma and australia are all absolutely astonishingly beautiful countries  so i probably shouldnt mind going back and im still open to these countries    i think i slightly prefer going to a 3rd ""2nd"" world country over a 1st world country  but it isnt out of the question  continents  id rather not go to a european country  though it isnt out of the question  in case it matches my interests perfectly  length time  a couple of months  i dont have a specific length in mind  but i can travel between february and july  climate  for now i dont have a specific climate in mind that i prefer detest  although i think i dislike a warm   humid climate the most budget  unsure  i have a couple thousand euros saved and will save more in the upcoming months  that said  i will start uni next year so i dont want to spend it all  but i guess how much i spend save is in my control    interests  animals  kids  nature  i like going on hikes or horseback riding or exploring the country in other ways  though i would like to do some ""touristy things"" activities  i would also like to see day to day life as it is for the locals  i dont mind working doing volunteer work while im on a holiday either  especially if it involves animals and or kids safety  im traveling alone as a caucasian  18 year old girl woman  so i guess i want to take that into consideration  i know that my safety is largely dependent on me being smart about where i go what time i go  etc   but still  for my and my familys ease of mind  i would prefer to avoid war zones  additional info    i dont have my drivers licence yet  but even if i will by that time  i would prefer not to go road tripping  i wouldnt mind using a plane or public transport to go from place to place  traveling by bike or horse is an option as well    im vegan  and although i think it would be possible to get a vegan meal  almost  everywhere  i thought id include it just in case      i wouldnt mind visiting multiple countries  though i dont want to fly halfway across the world from one destination to the next  i hope this is enough information and that any of you can help me

9xnsa8,one of the highest rated comments on the recent thread about the bad state of overwatch; hots team take heed.,94.0,88.0,109.0,heroesofthestorm,"i dont play ow but since the recent post responding to former pro player seagulls video detailing the poor state of the game made it to the front page  i skimmed a lot of the comments and this one stuck out to me because ive seen too much of this in ranked hots play  https   imgur com a ke6q7nq  https   imgur com a ke6q7nq i agree with the games mvp selection maybe less than 50  of the time i would say  and there have been times where i have flat out thought the mvp didnt deserve it at all or even where i felt the mvp was quite literally the lvp  and many a time where i feel the player with the most contribution to victory didnt even show up on the screen at all   other awards such as ""escape artist "" ""scrapper "" or ""bulwark"" often get awarded to players who mindlessly and pointlessly brawled or fed like machines  ""seige master"" or ""experienced"" can go to players who did nothing but lane all game   but most perniciously    it encourages an attitude that is completely contrary to the mindset successful hots players need to have    seeing past yourself and understanding that every action or decision you take as an individual should be what benefits your team as a whole and leads towards the goal of killing the enemy core at the end of the game  not what benefits your stat line   if youre an assassin youre going to do a lot more damage if you have a tank who peels and sets up kills for you effectively   if youre a support youll have a lot more heals if your teammates understand how you heal them and work with you to help you help them   if youre a tank youll do better if you think about what your back line needs more  initiation or counter initiation and peel   if youre a solo laner or split pusher youre going to do better if you communicate about what youre doing and why   and finally  there are a lot of little choices and nuances that define good play that just dont show up on a stats sheet at the end of a game   take a warning from ow and address this now  if an mvp screen exists it should be based on player votes only and not some algorithm  and there should be a category to nominate players for making a ""play of the game ""   a commendation system would be much more useful to encourage more constructive behavior between teams   edit  im getting a lot of comments saying most people ignore or dont put much stock in the commendation screen or mvp  my response to that is one  neither do i  and two  well thats just another reason to do away with it then  isnt it   if experienced players ignore it and the inexperienced players are mislead by it  improve it or get rid of it

8ihciy,intentionally not naming stuff,23.0,11.0,30.0,worldbuilding,"or naming it intentionally functional rather than giving it a whatever name lets be clear  im terrible at naming stuff  i admit that  however i found it over 750k words written in my fantasy story  that i dont rely need naming stuff  hell  even by going the empire™ or the human empire™ i set up a temporary greater enemy for all ""good guys™""  but then  halfway through the story  as a by the way event  the empire was all but overthrown  all of its officials and men of power assassinated and then replaced by the joined effort of two paramilitary organisations who then assumed control of the region  and by the time my second arc commences  have led it to successful world domination in the second arc  i have evil corporations™ who i didnt name  this way  theres no one bad guy the heroes need to defeat  and can actually go about trying to live theur lives  yes  they do government sanctioned missions against said evil corporations  but its never clear to them who exactly they are fighting and for what reason  these things are just bigger than them  and rather than making some one thing a greater enemy  theres a set of beliefs and standards they have to go against im not sure if i got my point across or if this was just a big ramble  but i had to get it out of me  thanks for reading this long

4hncbr,programming schools/ industry recomendations,6.0,0.0,44.0,learnprogramming,i have been going to school at fullsail for about a year and before my full first year i decided to switch my major from game development to software development because theres a better job market and they treat you some what better  before i go on i would like to say for the millions of people that dont know what full sail is it is a bushiness type school that trains you for 2 years 8 hour a day classes 5 days a week for your field and then gives you a bacholers degree and its for profit  i have been thinking about if my school is a good place for me to be learning about this if i cant get a decent job in the field with only 2 years under my belt with c   and c  background no certifications and i dont really think i put my self in the best position to be going to a shitty school getting all of this debt and not even get the job i want the question for you guys is what knowledge do you think a good no experience programmer should have and what schools do you think offer the best computer science   software program,499.0,117.0,0.75,2016-05-03 06:53:08,tony55544,0.0,0.0,4.0,1029.0,207.0,117,__i

9oqz67,does this fake pokemon movie plot sound familiar to anyone?,4.0,5.0,59.0,pokemon,"heres the backstory   when i was about 10 years old  2008   i was reading about pokemon on wikipedia or another wiki and i came across an article for a movie i hadnt seen before the plot goes that ash and his crew went to a ramen place for lunch and the food that ash ate had been poisoned by team rocket and he died   at the same time  deoxys was attacking the city and so ashs cousin had to help misty and brock battle it   thats all i remember now obviously  this is fake   my question is  has anyone else ever heard of something like this and gotten pranked like me   i am almost completely certain that i did read this article  but the second time i looked for it i couldnt find anything   i remember telling my friends at school about it the next day   i know it couldnt have been a fanfiction because what i read was definitely a plot summary as opposed to a detailed story     x200b on another note  i also remember looking at pictures on google images of fake pokemon fake game covers during that same time period   one of the fake games was something along the lines of ""pokemon dark version"" and had a purple cover with what i remember looking like a genesect   how do i remember that   when the actual genesect was released in canon  i had a discussion with my sister where i said something like ""i refuse to believe that thats a real pokemon because i saw it on a fake game cover in like 5th grade ""  x200b do either of these things sound familiar to anyone else   i know it had to be around 2008 because diamond and pearl came out in 2006 and i got my copy of diamond about a year after everyone else  and i also remember what house i lived in at the time ",230.0,115.0,0.58,2018-10-16 22:34:52,zbdb13,0.0,0.0,10.0,1689.0,318.0,182,"__h _he her ere res __t _th the __b _ba bac ack cks kst sto tor ory ry: __w _wh whe hen __i __w _wa was __a _ab abo bou out __1 _10 __y _ye yea ear ars __o _ol old __( _(2 (20 200 008 08) 8), __i __w _wa was __r _re rea ead adi din ing __a _ab abo bou out __p _po pok oke kem emo mon __o _on __w _wi wik iki kip ipe ped edi dia __o _or __a _an ano not oth the her __w _wi wik iki __a _an and __i __c _ca cam ame __a _ac acr cro ros oss __a _an __a _ar art rti tic icl cle __f _fo for __a __m _mo mov ovi vie __i __h _ha had adn dnt __s _se see een __b _be bef efo for ore re. e.t .th the __p _pl plo lot __g _go goe oes __t _th tha hat __a _as ash __a _an and __h _hi his __c _cr cre rew __w _we wen ent __t _to __a __r _ra ram ame men __p _pl pla lac ace __f _fo for __l _lu lun unc nch __a _an and __t _th the __f _fo foo ood __t _th tha hat __a _as ash __a _at ate __h _ha had __b _be bee een __p _po poi ois iso son one ned __b _by __t _te tea eam __r _ro roc ock cke ket __a _an and __h _he __d _di die ied ed. __a _at __t _th the __s _sa sam ame __t _ti tim ime me, __d _de deo eox oxy xys __w _wa was __a _at att tta tac ack cki kin ing __t _th the __c _ci cit ity __a _an and __s _so __a _as ash shs __c _co cou ous usi sin __h _ha had __t _to __h _he hel elp __m _mi mis ist sty __a _an and __b _br bro roc ock __b _ba bat att ttl tle __i _it it. __t _th tha hat ats __a _al all __i __r _re rem eme mem emb mbe ber er. r.n .no now __o _ob obv bvi vio iou ous usl sly ly, __t _th thi his __i _is __f _fa fak ake ke. __m _my __q _qu que ues est sti tio ion __i _is is, __h _ha has __a _an any nyo yon one __e _el els lse __e _ev eve ver __h _he hea ear ard __o _of __s _so som ome met eth thi hin ing __l _li lik ike __t _th thi his __a _an and __g _go got ott tte ten __p _pr pra ran ank nke ked __l _li lik ike __m _me me?

9ubpsu,most cinematic fight i've seen in a game,5.0,14.0,40.0,gaming,breach mode is a long  complex match that requires more than simply winning fights  unlike dominion or deathmatch  it is not straight forward how to be victorious  many facets of the mode are not immediately obvious  so i thought it would be useful to make a post that talked about the mechanics of the mode that ive noticed  and hopefully start a discussion on tips and tricks to do better in breach  just prior to marching fires release i made another post  here  https   www reddit com r forhonor comments 9oq04a breach meta analysis feats perks characters and    much of that information is obsolete by this post  but i think the discussion of perks  feats  and roles is still useful  the strategy of the mode changes whether you are attacking or defending  so this post will be split up between the two there is a tl dr at the end  attackersas attacker you must be constantly attending to objectives  both the ram and the ramparts speed is increased by having an attacker present  this means that even if there are no opponents  pikemen  or archers to kill youll still be contributing to winning by just standing there    ramthe rams speed is somewhere between 2 4 times faster with a player beside it  youll know it is boosted because the soldiers will shout that they have help  and in the top right corner where the ram progress is tracked there will be two white arrows instead of one  conversely  if attackers have no players or pikemen by the ram there will be a red square indicating it has stopped  and with only a player and no pikemen youll have a single arrow as has been noted many times by now  the pikemen are very dangerous  this is both an advantage and a challenge for the attacker boosting the ram  it is an advantage because if you get attacked you can fall back into your pikemen formation and wait for help or deal with over aggressive defenders easily if they charge in  it is a challenge because of the damage you take while keeping the ram clear  and that means when defenders inevitably show up to kill you theyll have have a health advantage along with potentially the element of surprise  you need to take as little damage as possible while removing the opponents pikemen as fast as possible while also being aware of your surroundings for incoming ganks in my experience any character can boost the ram  but do so with different strengths and weaknesses  assassins in general have slower clear  though not berserker   but feats like stealth can make clearing safer as the enemy wont notice you as quickly  and kiai can be useful for running away to regroup when you inevitably get ganked  heavies have the ability to survive while waiting for help from their team and care less about attacks form pikemen  warlord for example blocks pikemen attacks while light attacking even when unlocked  vanguards kill the pikemen quickest  but also have the least options defensively  hybrids are case by case  but all of them have strengths to play to   rampartsthe ramp is less imperative to have an attacker on it at all times  while having an attacker on the point boosts the cap speed in a similar way to the ram being sped up by an attacker standing by it  you do not need to full cap a point to gain its benefits  the icons above the points are color coded to let you know its current state  and also show one or two arrows if it is currently being captured  if it is blue  the defender has control  if it is orange the attackers do  if it is orange outline with empty center it is captured  and can not longer be fought over  the outline shows how close to being capture it is at any time  and any time before it is capture it can be cleared of enemy minions can taken by the opposing team these archers do significant damage to the pikemen around the ram or in front of the commander  and possibly damage the ram and commander themselves  needs confirmation   taking temporary control of these as attacker is very useful  but focusing too much attention on the ramparts can be counter productive  not all archers can fire at the ram at all times  you can wait to control and capture later points  and spend time elsewhere until they become important  alternatively  if the defenders offer no opposition to taking these points quickly there is really no reason not to do so  then spend the rest of the phase contributing to team needs elsewhere whether a point needs to be captured or just controlled depends on what else you could be doing at the time  to capture a point you have to stand on it and do    nothing  which is not exciting or all the productive if your ram is currently being attacked or the flag has spawned  it is a judgement call every time whether you should take the time to finish capturing a point or just leave it with your archers on it unsecured one thing to note about the ramp points is they are one of the only places to heal on the map  as everyone knows there is a healing point  which if is not under your teams control can lead to a team of walking wounded  if youre in need of health the captains on the point are a great source  use your longest execution on them  just make sure youve killed all the opponents pikes first   flagthis objective is equally important for both sides  its location on each map determines whether it is easier for attackers or defenders to take  the knight and viking maps have pretty even positions in phase one and defender favored in phase two  the samurai map has an attacker favored in phase one  and pretty evenly placed flag in phase two these flags are super important  and very hard to keep track of  the first flag seems to spawn about 3 minutes into the match  and then spawns again about 4 minutes after it is used  the second flag likely spawns 3 minutes after the first gate falls  but i cannot say this with confident  i do know that when the flag is active  or possibly only when held  the two markers that show where to take it become visible to everyone  capturing the flag gives you health equal to roughly one more ram hit or cauldron drop  which can be the difference between moving on to the next phase or to the post match screen   guardiani really have no clear idea how to regard this objective  if youve wiped the enemy team and are nearby it is safe and useful to take it while ignoring your other objectives for a moment  sometimes it can be useful  albeit dangerous to sneak the guardian  just make sure you let your team know that is where you are so they can either help out or distract the enemy  here  as elsewhere  the quick chat is super useful  defendersfor defender the focus on ram and ramp is reversed    ramonce youve cleared opponent pikemen from the ram it will stop  and there is no longer any reason to stay there until an opponent or their pikemen reach the ram again to make it move  it doesnt require the constant presence that attackers need  which means the defenders have  in general  an advantage in fights elsewhere  in my experience the best way to deal with the ram is as quick as possibly with as many players as can be spared  hit the pikemen and any opponent fast  then leave to do something else   rampartsin contrast  the ramparts once captured cannot be reverted  all you can do after that happens is kill the archers to stop them shooting at your ram pikemen and teammates in that area  delaying capture of these points as long as possible  and reverting them to your teams control seems to me to be the primary objective of the defenders while the attackers are meant to keep the ram moving and get as much ramp control as possible   flag and guardianas far as i can tell  these really are the same for defenders as attackers  the flag is a must fight for  the guardian is a nice bonus or risky gambit  tl drthe attackers primary objective is the ram  its speed is 2 4 times faster with an attacker next to it an no enemy pikemen in the way the defenders primary objective is the ramp  control of this cannot be retaken  so delaying the attackers here as long as possible means youll have an easier time keeping the ram stalled and on most maps better control of the flag the flag is an absolute must fight for  the guardian is a bonus to take if youve won a fight  or something to try to sneak to get a needed advantage i hope this is helpful for some people  im sure a lot already know the information in it  i hope people comment with their opinions on breach  and feedback on this post thank you for

sure what i should use to build my website its a place for me to vent about how im autistic and im an idiot that keeps making stupid idiotic mistakes  i read at a bookstore that a person has a blog and twitter where she vents when she makes stupid mistakes  and she feels better because her followers laugh with her and say they wouldnt want her to change even if she is a huge idiot that did really bad mistakes that made things absolutely horrible for everybody    i tried twitter but its hard for me to get followers   i dont know how she did it i also want to post many other stories there that i write and i want to have a section about my game projects that im working on  with multiple pages for things about the games im not that good with html  though   i just know basic stuff like how to bold text   and like ten years ago someone mentioned something like ""github"" and i still dont know what it is and my older brother that always makes fun of me for liking anime and stuff would probably call me a geek  i said i should get a hdr tv and he kept making fun of it saying ""yeah we should get a hdl tv"" but i pronounce stuff wrong  my rs and ls sound similar  well he wasnt making fun of me but hes the god of life since hes my brother and its so confusing    i know some post on here mentioned github but i have no idea how to use it   i went to a github and it mentioned something about a code respiratory or something whatever that even means and there were all these files and folders and i didnt understand and yet i guess people keep linking people to it for projects

9kzsdj,anyone else annoyed with how absurdly high xenophile attraction gets whenever you try to run an inclusive and egalitarian empire?,45.0,25.0,129.0,Stellaris,basically i give everyone equal rights as citizens  aside from excluding rather unfitting species from military service  and after a while the xenophile faction pops up and gains some absurd level of attraction completely overshadowing my ruling ethics i find this wrong based on two arguments  first  im giving everyone equal rights because im running an egalitarian government which believes in so  of course this is ignoring the combination of egalitarian xenophobes   but this is the only special case   not because of specifically xenophilic policies  so i believe at least some of the pops who find this favorable should be attracted to the egalitarian faction  not xenophiles secondly  it might make sense that equal rights for xenos might attract more to be xenophilic  but the way the game currently considers what constitutes being xeno simply isnt right  right now anyone other than your primary founding species is considered to be xeno   but would you consider  lets say individuals of some race  who have been living with you as equals for decades or even centuries and are deeply integrated into your society  perhaps even numbering the same as or more than your people and co dominant with you  still as exotic aliens  i dont think so  living with them shouldnt make you somehow xenophilic nor should they still somehow regard themselves as outsiders newcomers and unconditionally support the xenophilic faction so i suggest that pdx probably should change the way the xenophile attraction currently works and make it possible for an empire to have multiple primary races like accepted cultures in the other games  make species that have long been members of equal standing of an empire treated as one of the main species and remove the automatic xenophile attraction currently in the game  i believe this makes more sense than the current system so  what do you think ,14501.0,3280.0,0.91,2018-10-03 13:04:57,euyis,0.0,0.0,20.0,1899.0,307.0,182,"__b _ba bas asi sic ica cal all lly __i __g _gi giv

a0b1lz,quick tips on braxis brawl (heroic),78.0,61.0,35.0,heroesofthestorm,"for anyone having trouble completing the brawl heres some things to remember     drafting  zarya is basically required    her shields  cleansing  cc  and aoe all priceless and she breaks cocoons fast   lucio generally best support  and then you want three bruisers melee assassins with self sustain  twin blades varian very useful to have as he can tank banelings and other high damage with shield wall and buff party armor healing   sonya and illidan also work  and xul is great at clearing packs of hydras   yrel is now usable but her armor buffing is less useful due to point  2 so it may be better to go heal build     hydralisks do   damage  kill them    they do ""giant killer"" damage  ignoring armor and high health pools  this is counter intuitive but a pack of hydras will do way more damage to your group than most enemy heroes except for certain high damage ones like tychus   this is also why taking tanks like arthas or johanna doesnt help     stay grouped  and keep moving     even if youre not going for good times and just want to complete the brawl  theres no need to linger to hunt down abathurs  kill every nydus worm  or pick up every single item  just move forward   abathurs respawn in different phases anyway so theres nothing to be gained by looking for them  and nydus worms only keep spawning minions if youre nearby and aggroing them   only really good items like nukes are worth detouring to get      the last fight right before the final boss stage is the most difficult     if you have to use items here use a psi emitter to buy time while you focus down nydus worms   this is a good place to focus down the worms to reduce the number of banelings and hydras coming at you       kite locusts     the locusts are not banelings  ive played with newer players who cant tell the difference   the locusts first appear in the area with the queen  zagara  and they hatch from the eggs   they also are spawned by the boss   they detonate after a short delay for huge damage over time so its important to keep moving through them and not tank the damage  as long as your hero isnt slowed  you can just set them all off without them hitting you or your team  so at least one player should be designated to set them off   lucio can be good for this with his speed and because hes not doing anything else in most fights       save items for last resort     save nukes for the final boss phase to kill nydus worms   honestly the boss phase isnt really difficult except you want to make sure you kill at least two of the nydus worms out of the four  as dealing with more than two heroes at once will overwhelm your group       anticipate the cc abilities of enemy heroes     the enemy heroes announce themselves before appearing so you can prepare  if for example you get stukov  hes going to shove the first hero he aggros  so that hero should engage him from an angle where the shove wont send him her too far   diablo always triggers lit breath after tackling and flipping his initial target  if you time a cc ability like zaryas graviton surge before he gets the lit breath off you can prevent it before hes unstoppable   zagara uses maw so its important to spread out to prevent her getting multiple members in it   etc   edit  im not 100  sure of this but i believe during the boss phase enemy heroes use the storm versions of their ults  so certain heroes become much more dangerous such as the butcher and dehaka who can silence your whole team      this is obvious but avoid avoidable damage     any kind of telegraphed damage like the tychus nuke  big red button   grunty fish  locusts  or boss stuns need to be avoided   edited for formatting ",23421.0,6197.0,0.89,2018-11-25 20:43:15,DarkRaven01,0.0,0.0,6.0,3705.0,660.0,368,"__f _fo for __a _an any nyo yon one __h _ha hav avi vin ing __t _tr tro rou oub ubl ble __c _co com omp mpl ple let eti tin ing __t _th the __b _br bra raw awl __h _he her ere res __s _so som ome __t _th thi hin ing ngs __t _to __r _re rem eme mem emb mbe ber er: r:* __* _** **d *dr dra raf aft fti tin ing ng: __z _za zar ary rya __i _is __b _ba bas asi sic ica cal all lly __r _re req equ qui uir ire red ed* d** **, __h _he her __s _sh shi hie iel eld lds ds, __c _cl cle lea ean ans nsi sin ing ng, __c _cc cc, __a _an and __a _ao aoe __a _al all __p _pr pri ric ice cel ele les ess __a _an and __s _sh she __b _br bre rea eak aks __c _co coc oco coo oon ons __f _fa fas ast st. __l _lu luc uci cio __g _ge gen ene ner era ral all lly __b _be bes est __s _su sup upp ppo por ort rt, __a _an and __t _th the hen __y _yo you __w _wa wan ant __t _th thr hre ree __b _br bru rui uis ise ser ers rs/ s/m /me mel ele lee __a _as ass ssa sas ass ssi sin ins __w _wi wit ith __s _se sel elf lf- f-s -su sus ust sta tai ain in;

8msjdy,remme - a real game changer!,0.0,4.0,28.0,CryptoCurrency,honestly  if you havent heard of remme check it out  ico took place in february 2018 and raised 20m usd within two days of the start of the token sale   i witnessed it  trust me   the chat was insane   the whole idea   passwordless entry to databases and business software with sensitive information  the protocol essentially links a device to an ssl certificate   links the ssl certificate to the blockchain so that users can then login with remme at the click of a single button  remme masternodes  a masternode will essentially authenticate logins and deal with the approval of certificates  users who run a masternode will receive 90  of the revenue generated from certificates  certificates cost  1 and need to be renewed annually  so lets do the numbers  remme plan the following q3 2018   launch of masternodes  requirements   250k tokens and an entry grade pc  at first there will only be 300 masternodes  based on a first come first served basis  with presale participants receiving priority  pilot programme  changelly   cryptocurrency exchange partnered with binance   over 500k users  mercury cash   unsurewandx   unsure unnamed fintech firm   500m users unnamed telecom company 640m users in total thats over 1b users  not sure how many certificates these businesses would need  however lets assume 10  do  thats 100m certificates  therefore  100m   0 9    90m split between 300 masternodes    300k revenue per node  per year  obviously  300 masternodes are only temporary and the number will increase over time  therefore  as the number of nodes increase the revenue per node may begin to decrease  it all depends on the speed of adoption and the user base behind remme  this coin has the potential to be huge  the team were in attendance at consensus 2018 and showed off the demo of their product  set to launch in q3 you wont want to miss this ,372.0,1219.0,0.5,2018-05-28 22:09:16,Wicked243,0.0,0.0,6.0,1901.0,318.0,205,"__h _ho hon one nes est stl tly ly, __i _if __y _yo you __h _ha hav ave ven ent __h _he hea ear ard __o _of __r _re rem emm mme __c _ch che hec eck __i _it __o _ou out ut. __i _ic ico __t _to too ook __p _pl pla lac ace __i _in __f _fe feb ebr bru rua uar ary __2 _20 201 018 __a _an and __r _ra rai ais ise sed __2 _20 20m __u _us usd __w _wi wit ith thi hin __t _tw two __d _da day ays __o _of __t _th the __s _st sta tar art __o _of __t _th the __t _to tok oke ken __s _sa sal ale le. __( _(i __w _wi wit itn tne nes ess sse sed __i _it it, __t _tr tru rus ust __m _me __- __t _th the __c _ch cha hat __w _wa was __i _in ins nsa san ane ne!

9xnsa8,one of the highest rated comments on the recent thread about the bad state of overwatch; hots team take heed.,94.0,88.0,109.0,heroesofthestorm,"i dont play ow but since the recent post responding to former pro player seagulls video detailing the poor state of the game made it to the front page  i skimmed a lot of the comments and this one stuck out to me because ive seen too much of this in ranked hots play  https   imgur com a ke6q7nq  https   imgur com a ke6q7nq i agree with the games mvp selection maybe less than 50  of the time i would say  and there have been times where i have flat out thought the mvp didnt deserve it at all or even where i felt the mvp was quite literally the lvp  and many a time where i feel the player with the most contribution to victory didnt even show up on the screen at all   other awards such as ""escape artist "" ""scrapper "" or ""bulwark"" often get awarded to players who mindlessly and pointlessly brawled or fed like machines  ""seige master"" or ""experienced"" can go to players who did nothing but lane all game   but most perniciously    it encourages an attitude that is completely contrary to the mindset successful hots players need to have    seeing past yourself and understanding that every action or decision you take as an individual should be what benefits your team as a whole and leads towards the goal of killing the enemy core at the end of the game  not what benefits your stat line   if youre an assassin youre going to do a lot more damage if you have a tank who peels and sets up kills for you effectively   if youre a support youll have a lot more heals if your teammates understand how you heal them and work with you to help you help them   if youre a tank youll do better if you think about what your back line needs more  initiation or counter initiation and peel   if youre a solo laner or split pusher youre going to do better if you communicate about what youre doing and why   and finally  there are a lot of little choices and nuances that define good play that just dont show up on a stats sheet at the end of a game   take a warning from ow and address this now  if an mvp screen exists it should be based on player votes only and not some algorithm  and there should be a category to nominate players for making a ""play of the game ""   a commendation system would be much more useful to encourage more constructive behavior between teams   edit  im getting a lot of comments saying most people ignore or dont put much stock in the commendation screen or mvp  my response to that is one  neither do i  and two  well thats just another reason to do away with it then  isnt it   if experienced players ignore it and the inexperienced players are mislead by it  improve it or get rid of it
