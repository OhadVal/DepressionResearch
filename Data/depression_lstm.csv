90hnyb,[tomt][movie] live-action kids movie from 2000's era,1.0,4.0,52.0,tipofmytongue,first time posting here  hoping someone might be able to help there was a film i remember watching once on tv  would have to be from the last decade or so  it was about three kids   two white boys and an asian american girl   who win a tour of a building where video games are made  while theyre there  they stumble across some sort of illegal activity involving some sort of computer chip  and eventually the fbi get involved somewhere in the midde of the film  i dont remember too much about the plot beyond this  but i know that by the end of the film  the three kids are seen slightly grown up and are now teenagers in high school  and have been recruited by the fbi  the girl is seen practicing some form of martial arts and failing until her cell phone goes off when she effortlessly overpowers her tutor so that she could leave  the red head boy is shown playing football and again not doing so well until his phone also rings  to which he wins the game for his team before running off  the other boy is seen having a driving lesson  performing all sorts of stunts while the instructor sits in shock  and the boy reveals that he was automatically given his license because of his status with the fbi before driving off i appreciate that that is too large a paragraph  but thats the general gist of all i remember  i know that one of the boys had an older sister who drove them around  i did find the imdb page for it once before  but there was literally no information on it whatsoever except the title   no cast or crew  plot synopsis or anything  im hoping someone might know the film from the above description alone  if it helps  the actors who played the three kids as children are the same when they play them in their teens  i believe  the similarites are too uncanny to be mere lookalikes ,4971.0,218.0,1.0,2018-07-20 19:54:32,solace-in-misery,0.0,0.0,7.0,1812.0,337.0,202,"__f

amqu1a,tweaking genji's mobility,0.0,9.0,25.0,heroesofthestorm,"i strongly believe like many that swift strike should not allow genji to pass over terrain or go through walls   theres already so much power built into his e through talents and just baseline that weve seen it nerfed incrementally several times already to try and bring down his power   i believe that its ability to make flashy and fun to watch plays like tower diving in and out to get kills is why this terrain bypass remains in the game  but its oppressive due to the extreme range of swift strike  allowing genji to strike unexpectedly from any angle at all   to try and preserve the ""fun factor"" of flashy plays for genji while still removing terrain bypass from his e  i propose a compromise     make his level one talent   pathfinder   not suck     pathfinder additional functionality jumping over terrain with cyber agility increases genjis movement speed by 25  for 6 seconds  and resets its cooldown   this effect cannot occur more than once every 30 seconds    this change would create a more interesting level 1 talent diversity for genji   pathfinder would enable ""double jump"" plays and flashy terrain bypass plays or tower diving that his e made just a little too easy   if combined with the actual double jump talent later one it could allow for a true ""acrobatic"" build  but of course choosing these talents comes with tradeoffs by not picking the other good talent options on those tiers   to me thats better design than allowing genji to teleport around how he pleases with his primary bread and butter damage skill   ",23421.0,6197.0,0.33,2019-02-03 18:05:15,DarkRaven01,0.0,0.0,3.0,1555.0,261.0,170,"__i __s _st str tro ron ong ngl gly __b _be bel eli lie iev eve __l _li lik ike __m _ma

employee turnover rate thats unbelievable in this age of the necessity of a job  everyone i know has less than 9 months of experience other than my managers  and ive been refused raises due to our stores performance  my co workers dont give me any respect  even though ive taught them nearly everything about the job and i really only care for a couple of my co workers left  i know its the higher road to give a two weeks notice to the boss before were supposed to leave  but ive been absolutely stressed out of my mind to the point that im losing sleep over it now  im not just some random guy that managed to hang on to the job for this long  but ive come to enjoy the company of some of the customers that come through our pharmacy and since our pharmacists were switched out with these new

stay because of them  but just the amount disrespect that i get from behind the counter is overwhelming  ive gotten my other pharmacists recommendations and they allowed me to use them as references

9c315c,"so does an electron exist as a standing wave, or not?",9.0,6.0,53.0,askscience,"im begun studying quantum mechanics in university and im stumped in 1923  de broglie postulated that just like how light can be quantized into photons  and thus act as both a particle and a wave  all matter displays wave particle duality  numerous sources online say that de broglie also proposed that electrons  who would possess wave like properties thus   exist   as standing waves  interfering with themselves as they move around the nucleus  as standing waves have specific frequencies for them to form  this would explain how electrons can only exist at discrete energy levels ​my question is   electrons definitely do not exist as standing waves do they  they exist within a cloud of probability density  where their charges are somewhat smudged out  not really in one place  im not interested in  what  an electron looks like or its position  but if electrons are standing waves  then how does that play into the formation of orbitals ​other sources say that electrons   do not exist   as standing waves  but are merely a good analogy for how the electron really works  others state that the standing waves are the results of calculating through schrodingers equation  whatever that means  but arent orbital shapes the result of the equation  does that mean that orbitals are 3d standing waves   x200b ive realized that in studying quantum mechanics  lots of times things are said to be facts  then on a deeper level its more of a ""gotcha  its actually false but i said it was what it was so you could understand that  then i can say its false when you really dig deeper "" im doubting whether or not im just not all that bright ​please shed some light on this  thank you for any clarification given ",720.0,838.0,0.64,2018-09-01 16:27:24,Xeldith,0.0,0.0,11.0,1735.0,292.0,172,"__i _im __b _be beg egu gun __s _st stu tud udy dyi yin ing __q _qu qua uan ant ntu tum __m _me mec ech cha han ani nic ics __i _in __u _un uni niv ive ver ers rsi sit ity __a _an and __i _im __s _st stu tum ump mpe ped ed. d.i .in __1 _19 192 923 23, __d _de __b _br bro rog ogl gli lie __p _po pos ost stu tul ula lat ate ted __t _th tha hat __j _ju jus ust __l _li lik ike __h _ho how __l _li lig igh ght __c _ca can __b _be __q _qu qua uan ant nti tiz ize zed __i _in int nto __p _ph pho hot oto ton ons ns, __a _an and __t _th thu hus __a _ac act __a _as __b _bo bot oth __a __p _pa par art rti tic icl cle __a _an and __a __w _wa wav ave ve, __a _al all __m _ma mat att tte ter __d _di dis isp spl pla lay ays __w _wa wav ave ve- e-p -pa par art rti tic icl cle __d _du dua ual ali lit ity ty. __n _nu num ume mer ero rou ous __s _so sou our urc rce ces __o _on onl nli lin ine __s _sa say __t _th tha hat __d _de __b _br bro rog ogl gli lie __a _al als lso __p _pr pro rop opo pos ose sed __t _th tha hat __e _el ele lec ect ctr tro ron ons ns, __w _wh who __w _wo wou oul uld __p _po pos oss sse ses ess __w _wa wav ave ve- e-l -li lik ike __p _pr pro rop ope per ert rti tie ies __t _th thu hus __* _** **e *ex exi xis ist st* t** __a _as __s _st sta tan and ndi din ing __w _wa wav ave ves es, __i _in int nte ter erf rfe fer eri rin ing __w _wi wit ith __t _th the hem ems mse sel elv lve ves __a _as __t _th the hey __m _mo mov ove __a _ar aro rou oun und __t _th the __n _nu nuc ucl cle leu eus us. __a _as __s _st sta tan and ndi din ing __w _wa wav ave ves __h _ha hav ave __s _sp spe pec eci cif ifi fic __f _fr fre req equ que uen enc nci cie ies __f _fo for __t _th the hem __t _to __f _fo for orm rm, __t _th thi his __w _wo wou oul uld __e _ex exp xpl pla lai ain __h _ho how __e _el ele lec ect ctr tro ron ons __c _ca can __o _on onl nly __e _ex exi xis ist __a _at __d _di dis isc scr cre ret ete __e _en ene ner erg rgy __l _le lev eve vel els ls. s.​ .​m ​my __q _qu que ues est sti tio ion __i _is __: __e _el ele lec ect ctr tro ron ons __d _de def efi fin ini nit ite tel ely __d _do __n _no not __e _ex exi xis ist __a _as __s _st sta tan and ndi din ing __w _wa wav ave ves __d _do __t _th the hey ey?

6jv6vk,[dm-ing] [homebrew] giving pcs an instakill ability,0.0,5.0,51.0,DnD,  bigrim  avarian  targan  spoilers ahead  so  dont read this  or do  but dont incur your dms wrath by playing as though youve been spoiled   so  ive sent my three 5th level pcs after a  sword with a sea hags eye as a pommel stone  https   www reddit com r dnd comments 6jgiy4 dming homebrew looking for ideas hags eye as    and im rather enamored with the idea of attaching the sea hags horrific appearance and death glare abilities to it  but the potential to give a pc instakills seems pretty op heres what ive got so far   you can use an action to take on an illusory horrific appearance  you resemble yourself  but take on the appearance of an undead drowning victim or a monstrous mashup of yourself and sea life  covered in barnacles  draped in seaweed  scaly  clammy skin etc    you maintain this form for 1 minute or until you end it as an action  you must concentrate on this effect as though concentrating on a spell     any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of you and can see you must succeed on a dc11  wisdom save or be frightened for 1 minute  a frightened creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns  with disadvantage if you are within its line of sight  ending the effect on itself on a success     a creature that succeeds on its saving throw or ends the effect on itself is immune to the effects of your horrific appearance for 24 hours   …  once you use this ability you cannot use it again until the next dawn now  id like to add in some variant of the sea hags   death glare    which uses the hags action to cause a frightened target to make a dc11 wisdom save  dropping to 0 hit points on a failed save   but dropping a target to 0 hp on a failed save seems like a dangerous ability to give a pc  is that balanced out by the enemy having to fail two dc11 saving throws  the first of which grants immunity to its effects on a successful save  or by the fact that the horrific appearance ability im stealing makes no distinction between friend and foe  and  having been a pc in this party  i know how terrible all their wisdom scores are  would it be better to have it deal necrotic damage comparable to a single target spell of the players level  e g  a third level  inflict wounds   would only getting death glare once for each casting of horrific appearance be good  or would that cheapen it too much if the enemies keep making their saves i dont know  help me out  whats the version of this weapon you would give out  edit  explained the sea hags death glare action  ­  considering that the sword is getting this power from a part of a monster attached to it  im going to use that monsters save dcs ,25042.0,1523.0,0.5,2017-06-27

homeworld of macragge when a massive orokin derelict that is being used by a tenno moon clan as their dojo emerges from the void  chapter librarians and any psykers in the system are immediately aware of the strong warp energy emitted by this ship and assume it a creation of chaos robute guilliman himself decides to lead a massive force of space marines on board this craft to eliminate the assumed chaos presencerule 1  the ultramarines are limited to forces that could feasibly fit inside a tenno dojo  so no large tanks or titans rule 2  the ultramarines are unable to use virus bombs or attempt to destroy the derelict from outsiderule 3  the tenno are able to be permanently killed  i am assuming the tenno have been disconnected from the womb of the sky and are no longer immortal while in the warhammer universe rule 4  the ultramarines are unable to call for any kind of reinforcements due to “warp interference” created by the derelict essentially jamming their

8n1dhz,did google ever give us any sort of explanation for why they made the ability to reply to comments of comments non-functional?,4.0,3.0,126.0,youtube,i know its been a while now  but it still pisses me off  it used to be that if you read a comment thread and wanted to reply to what somebody wrote in there  you could reply to just that comment specifically  and there would be a new sub thread created just for your particular response  and in case of multiple replies  every reply has a tag with the persons name to whom  theyre talking to  its there for everybody to see  everybody knows who which comment youre replying to now if you want to reply to a person it just tacks your message onto the bottom of the thread with zero context  no indication whatsoever who or what youre replying to specifically  its just lost and meaningless  the person youre replying to wont even know a lot of the time because everybody who replied previously gets a friggin notification too its just hard for me to wrap my head around what they did  it was completely functional previously  why would they intentionally remove a feature that promotes actual engaging discussions rather than mindless blathering  even though that was about 90  of youtube comments anyway ,11044.0,6833.0,0.83,2018-05-29 21:22:40,Regnes,0.0,0.0,22.0,1119.0,194.0,120,"__i __k _kn kno now __i _it its __b _be bee een __a

879f4k,now i'm 100% sure vision won't die in infinity war,1.0,15.0,50.0,marvelstudios,"hi guys  ive been lurking on this subreddit for a couple of months and i want to share a theor of mine  if you could call it a theory  its more of an observation  about visions fate in iw like many people online i was inclined to believe that he wont survive in iw  but now with the new released footage i doubt that this will be the case  let me explain vision was created with the help of the mind stone  so it was enstablished from the very start that somehow when thanos arrives hell be in danger  hes not a main character  people dont care that much about him as they care about other characters as cap or tony  why do they insist on the ""omg vision will die   "" story in the trailers and the tv spots  we already knew thanos   co  will be after him  there is nothing we didnt already know  why use footage with him being attacked by the back order and the one when hes telling wanda theyre out of time if hes been already half dead since ultron put the mind stone in his head  i watched the trailer reactions on youtube and everybody is like ""meh this is what i expected""  theres no emotional response except from those who really like him  i noticed that most people are indifferent or dislike him  dunno why   what if theyre pushing this to mask something bigger  i think he wil play an important role in the movie  dont ask me what role cause i dont know  but i find it suspicious that they put those scenes in the trailers  if a character will die why would you spoil it oh  and another reason i think its safe  they also showed us that he and want are finally in a relationship  killing him will result in wanda going mad and not being able to control her powers  which will be basically age of ultron v2 0  she was devastated when pietro died and i dont see the point in doing the same thing again  killing someone she loves  it would mean 0 character development for her  and it will be disappointing to find out that the villain is destroyed by a furious wanda who is grieving a character most people dont care too much about  not to say itd be bad writing 101 tldr i think the footage with vision being tortured being in pain from the trailers is just a distraction to make us not to think too much about him just to hide his possible big role in the events of the movie ",200.0,1343.0,0.59,2018-03-26 16:15:50,antricotul,0.0,0.0,10.0,2312.0,438.0,237,"__h _hi __g _gu guy uys ys, __i _iv ive __b _be bee een __l _lu lur urk rki kin ing __o _on __t _th thi his __s _su sub ubr bre red edd ddi dit __f _fo for __a __c _co cou oup upl ple __o _of __m _mo mon ont nth ths __a _an and __i __w _wa wan ant __t _to __s _sh sha har are __a __t _th the heo eor __o _of __m _mi min ine __( _(i (if __y _yo you __c _co cou oul uld __c _ca cal all __i _it __a __t _th the heo eor ory ry, __i _it its __m _mo mor ore __o _of __a _an __o _ob obs bse ser erv rva vat ati tio ion on) __a _ab abo bou out __v _vi vis isi sio ion ons __f _fa fat ate __i _in __i _iw iw. w.l .li lik ike __m _ma man any __p _pe peo eop opl ple __o _on onl nli lin ine __i __w _wa was __i _in inc ncl cli lin ine ned __t _to __b _be bel eli lie iev eve __t _th tha hat __h _he __w _wo won ont __s _su sur urv rvi viv ive __i _in __i _iw iw. __b _bu but __n _no now __w _wi wit ith __t _th the __n _ne new __r _re rel ele lea eas ase sed __f _fo foo oot ota tag age __i __d _do dou oub ubt __t _th tha hat __t _th thi his __w _wi wil ill __b _be __t _th the __c _ca cas ase se. __l _le let __m _me __e _ex exp xpl pla lai ain in. n.v .vi vis isi sio ion __w _wa was __c _cr cre rea eat ate ted __w _wi wit ith __t _th the __h _he hel elp __o _of __t _th the __m _mi min ind __s _st sto ton one ne, __s _so __i _it __w _wa was __e _en ens nst sta tab abl bli lis ish she hed __f _fr fro rom __t _th the __v _ve ver ery __s _st sta tar art __t _th tha hat __s _so som ome meh eho how __w _wh whe hen __t _th tha han ano nos __a _ar arr rri riv ive ves __h _he hel ell __b _be __i _in __d _da dan ang nge ger er. __h _he hes __n _no not __a __m _ma mai ain __c _ch cha har ara rac act cte ter er, __p _pe peo eop opl ple __d _do don ont __c _ca car are __t _th tha hat __m _mu muc uch __a _ab abo bou out __h _hi him __a _as __t _th the hey __c _ca car are __a _ab abo bou out __o _ot oth the her __c _ch cha har ara rac act cte ter ers __a _as __c _ca cap __o _or __t _to ton ony ny. __w _wh why __d _do __t _th the hey __i _in ins nsi sis ist __o _on __t _th the __"" _""o ""om omg __v _vi vis isi sio ion __w _wi wil ill __d _di die ie! e!! !!! !!"" __s _st sto tor ory __i _in __t _th the __t _tr tra rai ail ile ler ers __a _an and __t _th the __t _tv __s _sp spo pot ots ts?

6cezew,what about you makes no sense at all?,3.0,1.0,37.0,AskReddit,"  31 year old male here  ive been struggling with depression and severe generalized anxiety for the last two years and at this point i have now exhausted all of my options to talk to people about my continuing downhill slide into my own personal hell     my doctor refuses to change my medication  my therapist keeps pushing appointments back months at a time  and my wife refuses to speak to me in regards to anything regarding my mental health  the only acceptable answer towards her is ""im fine "" and any other earns me a sharp  stinging retort that im being a baby and to just suck it up    ive lost all of my friends  some due to me being ""a downer"" and others because they figured that they were just too good to speak to me   its become ineffably clear that i am a forgotten soul  a lost cause  and that no one gives a damn whether or not i am around or not  in fact  id say without a doubt that if i were to disappear tomorrow  the only reason people would notice if i was gone or not is because the immense workload i have to deal with each day isnt getting done  even then there would be no one concerned  theyd just complain about how useless and unreliable i am   to put it in perspective  i work 14 hours a day  often six days a week  i then come home  cook meals  wash the dishes  and do whatever laundry needs to be done  on my day ""off"" i spend the day doing yardwork or maintenance on my home     yet  i am constantly told that i am ""lazy"" and that i simply dont do enough  between my mind slipping into total darkness and hopelessness  no one to talk to  being physically and emotionally exhausted  and feeling utterly worthless ive completely lost whatever will i have to live  the only reason i havent killed myself yet is that  like everything else i do  ill probably fuck it up and be left a useless cripple that everyone forgets  and ill have to spend the rest of my natural life alone and wishing i wasnt such a screw up  i just cant handle it anymore and i dont know what i can do  ",20348.0,295.0,1.0,2017-05-10 19:29:05,snufflesthefurball,0.0,0.0,8.0,2039.0,381.0,229,"__3 _31

8zhze9,anub'arak beetle build improvements,185.0,67.0,35.0,heroesofthestorm,ive always liked the idea of anubs beetle build  anubs trait is often overlooked but its quite unique among warriors   i would like to see this uniqueness not go to waste  but its always fallen short in reality  especially being outshined by way better talents on his tree   right now the scarabs are useful only for vision and a couple other niche uses such as soaking tower shots  interfering with skill shots  or interrupting channels of objectives on maps that have them however i believe with just a few changes  beetle build could be much more viable and provide a fun sustain   bruiser option for anub players   1   scarabs should have 50 spell armor baseline     resilient scarabs   new functionality should be 50 physical armor  making it harder to eliminate beetles with auto attacks as well    2   replace the current functionality of   legion of beetles   with the functionality of   beetle  juiced     it now creates scarabs on every third auto attack  and remove the requirement of hitting enemy heroes  3   make the new functionality of beetle juiced at 16 the capstone talent of the beetle build  as it should be  when anubarak auto attacks an enemy hero  all active scarabs become frenzied and gain  50  movement and attack speed for 3 seconds   this increases their annoyance factor and overall damage  and consequently the healing provided to anub through   leeching scarabs   which is currently too weak to really compete with his other options in the talent tree   ,23421.0,6197.0,0.91,2018-07-17

 however i found it over 750k words written in my fantasy story  that i dont rely need naming stuff  hell  even by going the empire™ or the human empire™ i set up a temporary greater enemy for all ""good guys™""  but then  halfway through the story  as a by the way event  the empire was all but overthrown  all of its officials and men of power assassinated and then replaced by the joined effort of two paramilitary organisations who then assumed control of the region  and by the time my second arc commences  have led it to successful world domination in the second arc  i have evil corporations™ who i didnt name  this way  theres no one bad guy the heroes need to defeat  and can actually go about trying to live theur lives  yes  they do government sanctioned missions against said evil corporations  but its never clear to them who exactly they are fighting and for what reason  these things are just bigger than them  and rather than making some one thing a greater enemy

90hnyb,[tomt][movie] live-action kids movie from 2000's era,1.0,4.0,52.0,tipofmytongue,first time posting here  hoping someone might be able to help there was a film i remember watching once on tv  would have to be from the last decade or so  it was about three kids   two white boys and an asian american girl   who win a tour of a building where video games are made  while theyre there  they stumble across some sort of illegal activity involving some sort of computer chip  and eventually the fbi get involved somewhere in the midde of the film  i dont remember too much about the plot beyond this  but i know that by the end of the film  the three kids are seen slightly grown up and are now teenagers in high school  and have been recruited by the fbi  the girl is seen practicing some form of martial arts and failing until her cell phone goes off when she effortlessly overpowers her tutor so that she could leave  the red head boy is shown playing football and again not doing so well until his phone also rings  to which he wins the game for his team before running off  the other boy is seen having a driving lesson  performing all sorts of stunts while the instructor sits in shock  and the boy reveals that he was automatically given his license because of his status with the fbi before driving off i appreciate that that is too large a paragraph  but thats the general gist of all i remember  i know that one of the boys had an older sister who drove them around  i did find the imdb page for it once before  but there was literally no information on it whatsoever except the title   no cast or crew  plot synopsis or anything  im hoping someone might know the film from the above description alone  if it helps  the actors who played the three kids as children are the same when they play them in their teens  i believe  the similarites are too uncanny to be mere lookalikes ,4971.0,218.0,1.0,2018-07-20 19:54:32,solace-in-misery,0.0,0.0,7.0,1812.0,337.0,202,"__f

8bxl3z,cylsie,8.0,0.0,6.0,worldbuilding,used to be a young technician  cylsie has become a unique being when she accidentally ended a civilization her age was higly advanced in both magic and technology  using magitech  they built a machine that wouldve given them infinite energy  and wouldve allowed them to advance even further at the core of the machine  there shouldve been a very precisely manufactured eldritch crystal  filled with all potential magic could give  the rest of the machine was to convert  realign  and distribute its energy in a useful form cylsie was a young technician working on the machine  she had a though to be broken  empty eldritch crystal  as a medal on her necklace  one day  out of curiosity  she placed the crystal into the machine  and it overloaded  and exploded  levelling her ages civilization  sending them back to the stone age as she lay in the rubble  she was surprised that she found herself unharmed  and feeling even a bit better than ever before  before her eyes  a man appeared from thin air  claiming to be one of the nex  the ruling class gods of the world  he was called yaldr he told her that her civilization was destroyed  and that it was her fault  he also told her that the energy surge she had caused was enough to half create a new nex  but since it couldnt form completely  its essence attached itself to cylsie  protecting her from the explosion  and fusing her soul with a nexs left with no other choice  cylsie joined yaldr  and he taught her all about the nex  in turn  she taught him all she new about mortals  and most importantly  how emotions work  theyre too mundane for a nex to comprehend them  but with cylsies help  yaldr could access them  the newfound ability amazed yaldr  he never thought something like this coukd exist  and was marveling in these emotions  he was not properly warned about the negatives  and their depths terrified him  hes decoded not to fully access them anymore time has passed  ages came and went  civilizations rose and fell  great things came to be  then were destroyed  and cylsie endured  a quadrillion years later  shes now the oldest being born in the mortal realm  and possibly the only one like herself ,8188.0,10435.0,0.91,2018-04-13 11:19:22,TheMomentofGallifrey,0.0,0.0,1.0,2195.0,378.0,225,"__u _us use sed __t _to __b _be __a __y _yo you oun ung __t

a0b1lz,quick tips on braxis brawl (heroic),78.0,61.0,35.0,heroesofthestorm,"for anyone having trouble completing the brawl heres some things to remember     drafting  zarya is basically required    her shields  cleansing  cc  and aoe all priceless and she breaks cocoons fast   lucio generally best support  and then you want three bruisers melee assassins with self sustain  twin blades varian very useful to have as he can tank banelings and other high damage with shield wall and buff party armor healing   sonya and illidan also work  and xul is great at clearing packs of hydras   yrel is now usable but her armor buffing is less useful due to point  2 so it may be better to go heal build     hydralisks do   damage  kill them    they do ""giant killer"" damage  ignoring armor and high health pools  this is counter intuitive but a pack of hydras will do way more damage to your group than most enemy heroes except for certain high damage ones like tychus   this is also why taking tanks like arthas or johanna doesnt help     stay grouped  and keep moving     even if youre not going for good times and just want to complete the brawl  theres no need to linger to hunt down abathurs  kill every nydus worm  or pick up every single item  just move forward   abathurs respawn in different phases anyway so theres nothing to be gained by looking for them  and nydus worms only keep spawning minions if youre nearby and aggroing them   only really good items like nukes are worth detouring to get      the last fight right before the final boss stage is the most difficult     if you have to use items here use a psi emitter to buy time while you focus down nydus worms   this is a good place to focus down the worms to reduce the number of banelings and hydras coming at you       kite locusts     the locusts are not banelings  ive played with newer players who cant tell the difference   the locusts first appear in the area with the queen  zagara  and they hatch from the eggs   they also are spawned by the boss   they detonate after a short delay for huge damage over time so its important to keep moving through them and not tank the damage  as long as your hero isnt slowed  you can just set them all off without them hitting you or your team  so at least one player should be designated to set them off   lucio can be good for this with his speed and because hes not doing anything else in most fights       save items for last resort     save nukes for the final boss phase to kill nydus worms   honestly the boss phase isnt really difficult except you want to make sure you kill at least two of the nydus worms out of the four  as dealing with more than two heroes at once will overwhelm your group       anticipate the cc abilities of enemy heroes     the enemy heroes announce themselves before appearing so you can prepare  if for example you get stukov  hes going to shove the first hero he aggros  so that hero should engage him from an angle where the shove wont send him her too far   diablo always triggers lit breath after tackling and flipping his initial target  if you time a cc ability like zaryas graviton surge before he gets the lit breath off you can prevent it before hes unstoppable   zagara uses maw so its important to spread out to prevent her getting multiple members in it   etc   edit  im not 100  sure of this but i believe during the boss phase enemy heroes use the storm versions of their ults  so certain heroes become much more dangerous such as the butcher and dehaka who can silence your whole team      this is obvious but avoid avoidable damage     any kind of telegraphed damage like the tychus nuke  big red button   grunty fish  locusts  or boss stuns need to be avoided   edited for formatting ",23421.0,6197.0,0.89,2018-11-25 20:43:15,DarkRaven01,0.0,0.0,6.0,3705.0,660.0,368,"__f _fo for __a _an any nyo yon one __h _ha hav avi vin ing __t _tr tro rou oub ubl ble __c _co com omp mpl ple let eti tin ing __t _th the __b _br bra raw awl __h _he her ere res __s _so som ome __t _th thi hin ing ngs __t _to __r _re rem eme mem emb mbe ber er: r:* __* _** **d *dr dra raf aft fti tin ing ng: __z _za zar ary rya __i _is __b _ba bas asi sic ica cal all lly __r _re req equ qui uir ire red ed* d** **, __h _he her __s _sh shi hie iel eld lds ds, __c _cl cle lea ean ans nsi sin ing ng, __c _cc cc, __a _an and __a _ao aoe __a _al all __p _pr pri ric ice cel ele les ess __a _an and __s _sh she __b _br bre rea eak aks __c _co coc oco coo oon ons __f _fa fas ast st. __l _lu luc uci cio __g _ge gen ene ner era ral all lly __b _be bes est __s _su sup upp ppo por ort rt, __a _an and __t _th the hen __y _yo you __w _wa wan ant __t _th thr hre ree __b _br bru rui uis ise ser ers rs/ s/m /me mel ele lee __a _as ass ssa sas ass ssi sin ins __w _wi wit ith __s _se sel elf lf- f-s -su sus ust sta tai ain in;

8opmn3,7 of my sims fiends passed away at her husband's funeral.,145.0,19.0,57.0,thesims,heres a link to  a few photos of the party  https   imgur com a cpsklt4 so my sim  liana  met akira kibo at the romance festival and they hit it off immediately  getting married before the festival was even over in a heat of the moment wedding  they had a very happy life and went on two have two children  today  akira passed away of old age and liana threw him a funeral to honor his life  everyone arrives and sees the casket  they all begin to cry and console each other while the minister gives his eulogy  then  bob pancakes makes his way to the kitchen to make the food because hes been my party chef for years  i know that everyone who died next likely coincidentally died of old age    but id like to think that bob was secretly in love with akira and that his death drove the man mad  if there were an option  the police would be full scale investigating bob for poisoning people at this funeral the funeral is getting ready to wrap up when suddenly  lianas best friend from young adulthood mitchell kalani keels over  while shes trying to process her new grief because she lost her husband and best friend on the same day  sims keep dropping like flies around her  next to them  the first friend she made in town brant hecking drops dead  along with his husband brent hecking  the grim reaper is going crazy trying to take note of everyone thats dying  when bob pancakes also drops dead  akiras old roomate miko ojo cant handle her grief and also dies immediately  while this all is happening in the kitchen  our acquaintance maaike cant handle the grief and dies in the living room  upstairs  jesminder bheeda has also hit her time  and collapses in my hallway with summer holiday watching  i cant believe this funeral could be considered a mass casualty sims style  surely i should get an achievement for this  lmaotldr  7 other sims decided to die at my husbands funeral today  edit  clearly

from game development to software development because theres a better job market and they treat you some what better  before i go on i would like to say for the millions of people that dont know what full sail is it is a bushiness type school that trains you for 2 years 8 hour a day classes 5 days a week for your field and then gives you a bacholers degree and its for profit  i have been thinking about if my school is a good place for me to be learning about this if i cant get a decent job in the field with only 2 years under my belt with c   and c  background no certifications and i dont really think i put my self in the best position to be going to a shitty school getting all of this debt and not even get the job i want the question for you guys is what knowledge do you think a good

6b73ju,[homebrew] [5e] invader's bane (aka dagger of banishment),2.0,0.0,57.0,DnD,"  avarian  bigrim  whatever character alex rolls when he gets out from behind the dm screen  dont read this   so  i just had an awesome idea  for a magic weapon  thought id share  see if anyone had any tips on finessing the language used in it a little backstory  im about to start running a side quest in my friends game  ive been going through dm withdrawal while my own game has been on hiatus  and these guys just seem like theyd be fun to dm for  weve floated the idea of having to rescue my pc from something  and i started figuring out who his archfey patron is and coming up with ideas for running something in the feywild rather early on  i devised the idea of this archfey bringing  something  into faerie from somewhere else and sending my pc to get rid of it  since we didnt level up quite as much as id hoped before the upcoming passing of the torch    this rather famous d d monster that i was planning to use as a boss may wind up being too tough  or else i might be taking over this game way longer than intended to get everyone to an appropriate level   so  i have to either scale it down  or seed novel ways to end its threat to faerie as we know it to the latter end  i was considering the spell  banishment   the monster isnt native to faerie  so they would definitely win by banishing it  and the spells vagueness about where on its native plane it returns to is exactly the kind of detail my archfey wouldnt worry about  i think the party will be 6th or 7th level by the time they reach my boss monster  so the full casters may or may not have access to 4th level spells  but i cant exactly count on the warlock taking  banishment  or the dm rolling up a caster  for the event  so  i thought about just leaving a scroll or a staff of  banishment   but that seems kinda obvious  also  where would it come from  the feys magic is too intrinsic for them to bother with such aids  but  if its a tool my patron lends to her begrudgingly loyal  mortal warlock… only  if it isnt a sword or armor  then its not really his style either…enter  invaders bane     invaders bane     weapon  dagger  rare  requires attunement by a creature proficient with daggers    you gain a  1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon   the blade of this dagger has several barbs along its edge  when you hit a creature with this dagger  it sticks in the creatures skin and can only be removed with a dc 15 strength check   while you are attuned to the dagger  you may use an action while you are touching it  and it is stuck in the skin of another creature to cast the  banishment  spell  save dc 15  on both the dagger and the creature that it is stuck into  if the target is native to the plane of existence youre on  it automatically succeeds on its saving throw   if the target fails its saving throw  both it and the dagger return to the targets native plane  and your attunement to the dagger ends  however  you always know the general location of the dagger if you are on the same plane of existence as it and no other creature has attuned to it so  ive got a cool way to get rid of the aberrant creature my characters patron brought to faerie  making it a weapon underscores the danger  no story ever had characters forging a magical blade just to kill the local bandits  they save that scene for the dragon or the dark lord   i make it difficult to hold onto after the fight  but give them a way to  perhaps  find it again at the regular dms discretion once the ball is back in his court  most importantly  ive given the players a way to cast  banishment  on the creature thats  in my opinion  way cooler than just giving them a scroll or a wand that craps out after so many charges   edit    i originally changed the casting time to a bonus action so that the attempt could be made in the same turn as the attack that lodges the dagger into the enemy  but decided that may be too powerful  as it could potentially one shot any extraplanar enemy  leaving it as an action forces you to take two turns  minimum ­  is it still a ""shower thought"" if it happened while doing dishes  is there a separate term for that  like ""chore thought"" ­   i think i took my own joke too seriously about wanting to gain two levels so that i could cast  find steed  on the ride home and increase the halflings humiliation about riding a rented mule  alas  the dungeon was far shorter than i anticipated and my warlock paladin didnt quite hit his 5th paladin level…",25042.0,1523.0,1.0,2017-05-15 02:52:55,unitedshoes,0.0,0.0,8.0,4528.0,842.0,419,"__* _** **a *av ava var ari ria ian an, __b _bi big igr gri rim im, __w _wh wha hat ate tev eve ver __c _ch cha

8opmn3,7 of my sims fiends passed away at her husband's funeral.,145.0,19.0,57.0,thesims,heres a link to  a few photos of the party  https   imgur com a cpsklt4 so my sim  liana  met akira kibo at the romance festival and they hit it off immediately  getting married before the festival was even over in a heat of the moment wedding  they had a very happy life and went on two have two children  today  akira passed away of old age and liana threw him a funeral to honor his life  everyone arrives and sees the casket  they all begin to cry and console each other while the minister gives his eulogy  then  bob pancakes makes his way to the kitchen to make the food because hes been my party chef for years  i know that everyone who died next likely coincidentally died of old age    but id like to think that bob was secretly in love with akira and that his death drove the man mad  if there were an option  the police would be full scale investigating bob for poisoning people at this funeral the funeral is getting ready to wrap up when suddenly  lianas best friend from young adulthood mitchell kalani keels over  while shes trying to process her new grief because she lost her husband and best friend on the same day  sims keep dropping like flies around her  next to them  the first friend she made in town brant hecking drops dead  along with his husband brent hecking  the grim reaper is going crazy trying to take note of everyone thats dying  when bob pancakes also drops dead  akiras old roomate miko ojo cant handle her grief and also dies immediately  while this all is happening in the kitchen  our acquaintance maaike cant handle the grief and dies in the living room  upstairs  jesminder bheeda has also hit her time  and collapses in my hallway with summer holiday watching  i cant believe this funeral could be considered a mass casualty sims style  surely i should get an achievement for this  lmaotldr  7 other sims decided to die at my husbands funeral today  edit  clearly that was supposed to be friends  not fiends  😂,1713.0,3260.0,0.99,2018-06-05 13:11:08,stonershyla,0.0,0.0,11.0,1977.0,350.0,223,"__h _he her ere res __a __l _li lin ink __t _to __[ _[a __f _fe few __p

82d6h4,[worldbuilding] looking for ideas for some fairly macabre fluff in my setting…,2.0,4.0,78.0,DnD,if youre playing a 5e game in vail  colorado and just finished killing a giant worm monster and stealing her crown to pay for your passage to blackwall  spoilers ahead  im not saying you cant read ahead  but its dangerous to let your dm know youve read his spoilers i just introduced an npc whose primary purpose is to reveal that  lord axel  the leader of a major faction and one of the most powerful figures in the region is actually axynohn  a blue dragon with enough wizard levels to cast  true polymorph  and disguise himself as this lord in the near future  theyre going to witness a blue dragon wyrmling hatching  and shes going to explain dragon politics for them and try to recruit them to help her take down axynohn\  at this point  ive gotta explain a little about dragons\   in my setting  dragons are governed by a complex political system  in which they endlessly compare themselves to their fellow dragons  trying to see whos best in terms of hoard value  power and value of their followers and more other factors than our puny human brains can comprehend  theres only ever one  major  dragon of each color at any given time  and as soon as a second one shows his or her face  theyre declaring themselves a rival  and a fight to the death between the two same colored dragons is guaranteed to happen soon  the colors of dragons are not directly inherited  i e  green dragons dont give birth to only green dragons  but rather each clutch of eggs contains dragons of a number of colors  the first to hatch from the clutch will consume all the other unborn dragons in his or her clutch as his or her first meal  due to the magical prowess of one of the first ancestral dragons  all dragons are born knowing draconic and how all this political stuff works what just occurred to me is that it would be great if the dragons had some superstitions tied to the eggs they eat when they first hatch  like consuming a white scaled sibling first might be an omen for something to happen  or hatching from a clutch that contains an opposite egg  i e  a chromatic hatching and having an unborn metallic dragon to eat  might be very auspicious because of how rare it is  a sign that this dragon is going to be extremely influential  this would also all tie into  why  they consume their siblings  that it isnt just for that burst of strength in the first hours of life  but also that its extremely bad luck to  say  let a second dragon hatch from your clutch and deal with a rival that early in life so  im curious if anyone has any ideas for superstitions relating to wyrmlings eating the eggs that would otherwise hatch into their siblings  i dont think it will be disturbing  enough  for my players to just witness this little dragon smashing its peers eggs and eating the contents as it pries information out of them and tries to sort out its place in the draconic political landscape  i want to add fratricidal  fratrivoric   superstition to it to really make a grotesquely memorable scene \  yes  shes cocky as shit  this will either not go well for her and anyone associated with her  or will take way longer than were likely to play this campaign  mainly  im just obsessed with the worldbuilding i already have around dragons and this was the best idea i had to incorporate it into this campaign \   for starters  they have two legs and two wings  none of this four legs and two wings business  no matter what the illustrations in the  monster manual  and every mini ive found so far try to tell me  but thats a whole other issue ,25042.0,1523.0,0.67,2018-03-06 09:06:58,unitedshoes,0.0,0.0,12.0,3574.0,638.0,333,"__i _if __y _yo you our ure __p _pl

ac3z7c,the ultramarines chapter of the adeptus astartes from warhammer 40k vs a tenno moon clan from warframe,8.0,4.0,102.0,whowouldwin,backstory  the majority of the ultramarines chapter are on their homeworld of macragge when a massive orokin derelict that is being used by a tenno moon clan as their dojo emerges from the void  chapter librarians and any psykers in the system are immediately aware of the strong warp energy emitted by this ship and assume it a creation of chaos robute guilliman himself decides to lead a massive force of space marines on board this craft to eliminate the assumed chaos presencerule 1  the ultramarines are limited to forces that could feasibly fit inside a tenno dojo  so no large tanks or titans rule 2  the ultramarines are unable to use virus bombs or attempt to destroy the derelict from outsiderule 3  the tenno are able to be permanently killed  i am assuming the tenno have been disconnected from the womb of the sky and are no longer immortal while in the warhammer universe rule 4  the ultramarines are unable to call for any kind of reinforcements due to “warp interference” created by the derelict essentially jamming their

6bbd3n,midday magathread: it's time we sat down and had an important discussion about this.,5121.0,473.0,84.0,The_Donald,for long enough now  weve just sat around and ignored this subject whilst its stared us long and hard in the face from the beginning of his presidency up until now  at this very moment  its been a heated topic that weve either just chosen to ignore  to deny  to argue ourselves out of or to blindly accept   that stops now   as a moderator ive been lucky enough to get a birds eye view on all this  ive seen countless threads and discussions argue anything but this topic  ive seen us willingly tackle every inch of this administration  up and down  to almost microscopic levels  often  we are very frank and honest in our discussion  if something notable comes up  we talk it out and reach intelligent conclusions yet theres this one matter that hasnt received its fair share of discussion  or for that matter  scrutiny  one very large chunk of this administration has seemed to have swept us all by without even a passing glance  isnt it time we held ourselves to account and faced up to it people  friends and foes  have been calling on us to do it  but for various reasons we havent  some have called for an independent investigation  others have called for impeachment  others have called on trump and us as moderators to step down  where you stand on this very critical issue means a lot to us  and thats why i  with the blessing of the rest of the mod panel  have decided to allow this discussion to go ahead i believe now is the time to stop running  and just flat out accept this reality  and debate it  for the good of the future of this sub  for the future of reddit  and for the future of the trump administration  we need to tackle this very significant  presidency affecting topic     why is the president allowed 2 scoops of ice cream whilst everyone else only gets 1     in peach him now  in peach donald drumpf   ,192216.0,106174.0,0.87,2017-05-15

9i31bg,honest question re: leaks,22.0,65.0,25.0,freefolk,just an honest question because i still feel a little out of the loop as a—let’s say “new regular”  i popped in occasionally last season in time to see ice dragon viserion  but have only over the past few months started checking the sub more regularly i keep thinking  in light of the recent leaks about tyrion’s trial  about hbo’s promise to film multiple endings to throw nosy fans off the scent  is this not a possibility for the most current leak  i only ask because i’m not seeing a lot of people bringing this possibility up  it seems that there are two camps  those who believe the leaks  and those who find that certain bits of info don’t match up  ie jon and dany’s absence from a trial they’d be hard pressed to miss  a ragtag assortment of other characters that seems somewhat northern dominant but also randomly has grey worm  a third tyrion trial and a second bran prosecution  a line that doesn’t exist in the show and doesn’t seem all that incriminating being used to deal tyrion his fate  the sfx guy blurting “tyrion dies” unprompted when gwen said they’re fined for revealing spoilers   the other thing is  looking at the scripts from season seven  d d seem to enjoy having fun with the cast  from “sophie’s gonna have to google the french lieutenant’s woman” to “fucking punkass little shitburger ” if they did film fake endings  wouldn’t they make them as off the rails and dramatic as possible  “they deserved it   ”  falls to knees  they might’ve had a lot of fun with that  putting this out there just because i feel like it accounts for both why certain elements don’t make sense  and  why sources close to the filming might truly and honestly believe this is how things go down—perhaps even they don’t know better but you all might have been following this longer and more closely and know more than i do  is there reason to 100  disbelieve hbo when they say they filmed multiple endings aside from speculation that they don’t have enough money ,47023.0,2331.0,0.81,2018-09-23 00:00:50,sleuthwood,0.0,0.0,4.0,1977.0,348.0,225,"__j _ju jus ust __a _an __h _ho hon one nes est __q _qu que ues est sti tio ion __b _be bec eca cau aus use __i __s _st sti til ill __f _fe fee eel __a __l _li lit itt ttl tle __o _ou out __o _of __t _th the __l _lo loo oop __a _as __a _a— a—l —le let et’ t’s __s _sa say __“ _“n “ne new __r _re reg egu gul ula lar ar” __( _(i __p _po pop opp ppe ped __i _in __o _oc occ cca cas asi sio ion ona nal all lly __l _la las ast __s _se sea eas aso son __i _in __t _ti tim ime __t _to __s _se see __i _ic ice __d _dr dra rag ago gon __v _vi vis ise ser eri rio ion on) __b _bu but __h _ha hav ave __o _on onl nly __o _ov ove ver __t _th the __p _pa pas ast __f _fe few __m _mo mon ont nth ths __s _st sta tar art rte ted __c _ch che hec eck cki kin ing __t _th the __s _su sub __m _mo mor ore __r _re reg egu gul ula lar arl rly ly. y.i __k _ke kee eep __t _th thi hin ink nki kin ing ng, __i _in __l _li lig igh ght __o _of __t _th the __r _re rec ece cen ent __l _le lea eak aks __a _ab abo bou out __t _ty tyr yri rio ion on’ n’s __t _tr tri ria ial al, __a _ab abo bou out __h _hb hbo bo’ o’s __p _pr pro rom omi mis ise __t _to __f _fi fil ilm __m _mu mul ult lti tip ipl ple __e _en end ndi din ing ngs __t _to __t _th thr hro row __n _no nos osy __f _fa fan ans __o _of off __t _th the __s _sc sce cen ent nt. __i _is __t _th thi his __n _no not __a __p _po pos oss ssi sib ibi bil ili lit ity __f _fo for __t _th the __m _mo mos ost __c _cu cur urr rre ren ent __l _le lea eak ak?

9v8vuh,cyclical magic,6.0,2.0,14.0,worldbuilding,hey yall  i wanna tell you something about my magic system universe  it will need a bit of backstory  so here it goes the base state of everything is utter chaos  infinite  eternal  totally random and has infinite potential of becoming anything  it occasionally does become something  but it usually never lasts for long at some point  there was a bunch of huge waves of creation within chaos  and when they ran together  order was created  it just so happened to create the exact opposite force of chaos  and so  a sort of bubble was made  its surface being a pure paradox the bubble expanded quickly  and from the paradox a lot of energy was created  this was enough to form an entity  an embodiment of order  called eldritch  it is being of pure order  and formed at the very edge of the universe  protecting it from chaos by holding up the universe somewhat like atlas does that sky in greek mythology in the chaos outside  theres still waves of creation and destruction  and these waves can be felt within the universe as well    here comes the real cyclical magic thing eldritch holds up the universe against chaos  and in the process  a lot of energy is created  half of this energy radiates back out ino chaos  but the other half goes through eldritch  a being pf pure order  and so gains orderly atributes  this energy is the source of magic within my universe because of the waves of chaos outside the universe  theres a certain cyclical nature to magic  namely  roughly every 40000 years or so  magic goes through its complete cycle  at its lowest  its about 1 10th the power that it is at its peak  and at these times  magic gets barely noticeable within the mortal realm  this is the time when technology tends to rise and reach its peak  and as magic slowly start seeping back into the universe  the tech gets combined with it into magitech  which then usually results in some war  natural disaster  or god induced cataclysm that puts back the civilisations of the mortal realm into a medieval stage    ask away  ill be around to answer most questions ,8188.0,10435.0,0.75,2018-11-08

9e5wdg,how vision will come back (jarvis tactic),4.0,3.0,41.0,marvelstudios,  x200b hi guys  i already made this post on another website but i thought it would be nice sharing this theory on reddit too  im curious about what you think about it   i know its a very big text but i think its worth a shot i have many reasons to think that vision didn’t really “die” in infinity war  a big one being that his body is synthetic – it can be changed rebuild  he’s not made of flesh and blood and unlike humans his body and his mind a i  everything that makes him himself can be separated without him actually dying  however it will be easier for me to use the term “die” while explaining this to you  just keep in mind that i’m using it for this reason not because i think he’s dead dead many people have their theories about how shuri was able to make a copy of the mind stone and that she and possibly banner and stark will try to rebuild vision using that copy  i think this is a possibility but honesty  and now i’m just subjective  i don’t think they will succeed  why  because it’ll be too simple  him returning so fast and with no consequences would feel cheap  there are many people online who complain about how ‘’useless’’ he was in infinity war and his return from the dead in these conditions won’t make anyone feel any better about him  to be honest  not even i want to see him coming back like this  even if i like him a lot  he’s a very underrated character and he’s hated on without any good reason  i’d like him to come back as the badass he is and prove he’s powerful  so  how would he do that as i said  i think he’s in the mind stone – “he” meaning anything he is besides body – his mind  memories  emotions  everything he took from ultron  jarvis  the science bros  i re watched age of ultron recently and i paid attention to the dialogue between bruce and tony when tony explained how jarvis survived ultron’s attacks  he said that jarvis ‘’went underground”  that he hid from ultron  tony’s words  “jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it”  i think this is how vision survived in infinity war  he “moved” everything in the mind stone  now  returning to aou  tony said about jarvis that “he didnt even know he was in there”  underground   my guess is that vision didn’t know he has this kind of “emergency plan”  he didn’t do it consciously but that it was something he was programed to do in case of extreme danger  this is why i think that when wanda destroyed the mind stone she actually destroyed him completely and if thanos wouldn’t use the time stone vision would’ve been gone for good  no hate for her   wanda wiped him out completely and in this case this emergency plan i talk about wouldn’t have worked  but thanos just separated the mind stone from his body  and yeah… crushed his skull  i don’t forgive you  thanos   what i’m saying is that that part of jarvis that is inside vision could’ve done the same thing in iw as he did in age of ultron do you remember the kitchen scene in civil war  vision said about the mind stone that “one day… who knows  i may even control it ”  why would they introduce the concept of him taking control of it if it would never happen  civil war  infinity war and avengers 4 have the same directors so i presume they had something in their minds when they used that line  i think we can all agree that shooting lasers out of the mind stone isn’t the main usage of it and nor it is the power of accessing the internet from your head  he has that from ultron   vision didn’t use it in the previous movies and i think it’s about time he used it properly – be more like jean grey or professor x than cyclops  it just seems counterproductive to give a character so much power and then not to use them again  this is why i’m saying that he’s now inside the mind stone and he’s finally understanding its true potential so… if i’m right with this theory how will it affect avengers 4  i think he’ll play the role of soldier behind enemy lines  just think about how he could influence thanos now that he’s mourning gamora  i’m far from being an expert in comics but i heard people saying that in the end thanos is his own worst enemy in the comics  and this could mean that he’ll probably change his mind after everything that happened with gamora  i didn’t think much about how vision will fight thanos because there are so many things that we won’t know until the release of the next movie and these things are linked to other things and it’s too hard to make predictions knowing so little  something i was thinking about  and now i’m entering the suspicious about what directors say zone  which is something i shouldn’t do if i want to keep my sanity intact  is what joe russo said about gamora being in the soul stone  directors and people involved in movies in general are ambiguous when they talk about what they do  so take this with a big grain of salt  he said “yeah  it’s implied that it’s the soul stone \ …\  when he goes inside the soul stone he has this kind of conversation with the younger version of his gamora ” so  it’s implied  maybe it truly is the soul stone or maybe it’s just a projection of his wounded conscience  he’s seeing gamora when there’s actually no one there  let’s say for the sake of those who want gamora to come back  me included  that she’s in the soul stone  this doesn’t affect what i’ll say  we know that the stones are all connected to each other  that they’re talking to each other  why wouldn’t vision then  while controlling the mind stone  control thanos’ mind and give him some illusions of gamora saying whatever it’s needed to be said in order to him changing his mind regretting what he’s done whatever  i’d like to see vision in this position  it’d give him a minor but major role in all of this and god how much i’d like him to finally use that damn stonehi guys  i already made this post on another website but i thought it would be nice sharing this theory on reddit too  im curious about what you think about it   i know its a very big text but i think its worth a shot i have many reasons to think that vision didn’t really “die” in infinity war  a big one being that his body is synthetic – it can be changed rebuild  he’s not made of flesh and blood and unlike humans his body and his mind a i  everything that makes him himself can be separated without him actually dying  however it will be easier for me to use the term “die” while explaining this to you  just keep in mind that i’m using it for this reason not because i think he’s dead dead many people have their theories about how shuri was able to make a copy of the mind stone and that she and possibly banner and stark will try to rebuild vision using that copy  i think this is a possibility but honesty  and now i’m just subjective  i don’t think they will succeed  why  because it’ll be too simple  him returning so fast and with no consequences would feel cheap  there are many people online who complain about how ‘’useless’’ he was in infinity war and his return from the dead in these conditions won’t make anyone feel any better about him  to be honest  not
